<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>This book was written through the inspirational
spirit of the well-known writer, Samuel
L. Clemens—“Mark Twain.” As I have never
before written a book, the reader will see that
I have had help from an unseen force—from
the Spirit World.</p>

<p>I was told through a trumpet seance meeting,
in the spirit voice of “Mark Twain,” to
get the materials and he would write me a
book—or, rather, that he would inspire me and
I could write it, but he would give me the
words to write, which he has done.</p>

<p>I was not in an unconscious condition. I
can turn from my writing and converse as if
I had not been at work through the power of
my guide. I can give abundance of proof of
this statement, also for the statement made in
the seance meeting by the spirit from Heaven.</p>

<p>“Mark Twain” has given me encouragement
from time to time in regard to my book, and
he has promised to write many more for me.</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">The Place of Trouble.—The
Convict’s Story.</span></h2>

<p>I passed by the house and within I heard
a noise. I stopped and listened, and I heard
screams. The voice sounded like that of a lady
whom I once knew. I was puzzled to know
what to do, but finally decided to enter. To
my surprise, I did know the lady. I apologized
for intruding, saying that I was attracted by
the terrible screams and thought I recognized
the voice.</p>

<p>The lady replied: “You are very kind, but
I think I shall be able to settle my trouble
without your help.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry, dear madam; I meant
well,” I said.</p>

<p>I took my departure, yet I felt that I should
not have done so under the circumstances, for
I knew that the talk the dear lady made was
through fear, as the master over her was standing
near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>I was greatly depressed, because of the way
in which I had left the place of trouble. I had
gone only a short distance when I decided to
return. I did so, and, to my surprise, I found
the dear lady dead, as it is called.</p>

<p>I was horrified. The brute had fled. What
was I to do? Go also and leave the poor dead
woman? I decided to do so. When at some
distance from the scene, I was hailed and confronted
by the real murderer and an officer,
who accused me of the terrible crime.</p>

<p>What could I do? I knew that I was not
guilty, but I failed to make the officer believe it.</p>

<p>I was taken to jail because of the crime
committed by the one who had me arrested.
But I had been seen coming from the house
and I had dropped my handkerchief while wiping
the tears from my eyes.</p>

MURDERER AND OFFICER.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>It was thought to be a plain case with
convincing proof—of circumstantial evidence.
Thrown in jail, I was at a loss to know what
to do. I was not guilty, but to prove it was
the next thing, and the most important thing
to do. I hailed the turnkey as he passed, and
asked for an attorney. I was favored with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
services of one. I did some good thinking as
to how I should prove my innocence.</p>

<p>“Well, my friend,” said the attorney, “I
have come to see what I can do for you. I
see you need help. You do not look like a
very bad man or a criminal.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, sir,” I replied. “I am not
either, but why am I accused of murder?”</p>

<p>“Murder! You a murderer? Oh, no, I
hope not!”</p>

<p>“I am not, but how shall I make the court
understand that I am innocent?”</p>

<p>“Well, my friend, explain your case.”</p>

<p>I explained matters, and he remarked: “I
do not see how the court could find an innocent
man like you guilty. I am going to show the
court without trouble that you are not guilty.
Have courage; I shall get you out of here as
soon as possible.”</p>

<p>The day of the trial was at hand. I had
become haggard and worn from the terrible
strain, from the uncomfortable cell which I had
occupied. My case was called. All ready, I
was told to take my oath, and then I was sworn
to tell the truth and nothing but the truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
If I could make the court understand that I
was innocent, I would soon be a free man.</p>

<p>“Will you tell the court all about this case?”
said my attorney.</p>

<p>I proceeded to do so, but, to my horror, I
was proved guilty to the jury and sentenced
by the judge.</p>

<p>What was I to do? I went back to jail to
wait for a new trial. If that failed, it meant
ten years in prison at hard work. I had been
convicted on circumstantial evidence, my handkerchief
being found in the house of the murdered
woman. I tried to console myself with
the belief that in some way I would be helped
out.</p>

<p>I had remained in jail three months when
one night I was thinking of the advice my poor
old mother had given me, and that was: “When
in trouble, pray, pray, pray!” I began to pray,
and as I prayed I felt encouraged. After that,
I prayed often, hoping that my prayers would
be answered. At last I could see that I was
fortunate to know within that I was not the
real murderer; then I thought that I should
pray for the murderer, and I did pray as I
never prayed before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, what a terrible thing it is to be accused
of a crime so great as that and be innocent!</p>

<p>A new trial was denied me. What was I
to do? God knows I was innocent, but I could
not make men believe so here on this earth.
The day for the journey to the penitentiary was
at hand, and I must go for another’s crime.</p>

<p>As the turnkey called us from our little, dark
cells he said: “Please get ready, for we will
have to take the morning train to your home—for
some of you a home for some time to come.”</p>

<p>That included me; that meant a home for
ten years—and innocent! I had no appetite
that morning, for I was thinking of the injustice
done to many innocent men, and I was
one of them.</p>

<p>We were locked together—shackled—and
started away to prison. On arrival we were
listed for different crimes. A murderer, numbered
78! And the worst, I thought, was when
they cut and shaved my head of hair. Then
I was told to don my new suit of stripes and
checks. That alone was enough to make any
man falter.</p>

<p>“This way,” I heard a gruff voice say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked for someone to look and in a second
I felt the strong arm.</p>

<p>“To you I am speaking. I want to show
you your cell.”</p>

<p>I had not recovered from the shock of my
garments. I was shoved headlong into my cell,
dark, and oh, so dreary! Anyone who could
experience my feelings at that moment would
never commit a crime.</p>

<p>I can not say that I rested well on my new
bed that night. I thought that morning would
never come. Yet I do not know why I should
have longed for day, as I had so long a time
to stay. At last breakfast was served—or, rather,
thrown at us. I was feverish and excited. All
the time I wondered what my work would be.
I did not have to wonder long. I was unlocked
from my cell and told to step out and fall in
line. I did so and onward we marched. A
halt was called and I was told to step aside.</p>

<p>A very important man, called guard, said:
“You are wanted here, sir!”</p>

<p>I stepped aside and was shown my work,
which was hard, even harder than anything I
had ever done. I was told to pick up the sledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and was shown in what shape to hammer the
iron.</p>

<p>I hesitated, and finally said: “My God!
man, I never did such hard work, and I don’t
think I can do this.”</p>

<p>All the sympathy I received was: “You do
the work or you will be thrown into a dark
dungeon to decide if you can, and you will get
bread and water until you do decide.”</p>

<p>I thought that I would as soon go into a
dungeon as to work myself to death. However,
I changed my mind and picked up the
sledge, but I had not strength to wield it.</p>

<p>I fell upon my knees and prayed that God
would give me help. While I was praying the
guard came up and with his monstrous club
gave me one blow, knocking me senseless.</p>

<p>I cried out as I came to my senses: “Man
alive, do not strike me again! Can you not
see I am not strong enough to do that work?”</p>

<p>“Oh! you fellows all have the same old gag
to tell. Not strong enough! Ha, ha! But
you are strong enough to strangle a poor woman
to death.”</p>

<p>I rose to my feet, and shouted: “I am an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
innocent man! I will be proven so before I
leave this prison.”</p>

<p>“All who are sent here are innocent. Some
of you surely get justice in trials.”</p>

<p>“I did not, for I was sentenced on circumstantial
evidence, and I know and my God
knows that I am innocent! The dear woman
who was murdered knows who killed her.”</p>

<p>“Well, the woman is dead, and you can not
prove by her that you did not kill her.”</p>

<p>“My friend, she is not dead. Her body is,
but her spirit is not, and she can and will come
and let it be known who the real murderer is.”</p>

<p>“Here, if you are crazy, we will put you in
the mad-house. I know when you are dead
you are dead.”</p>

<p>“I hope to be able to convince you before
I leave here that the body dies, but the spirit
lives on and returns and will and can talk.”</p>

<p>“Here, are you going to work? I have heard
enough of your foolish talk.”</p>

<p>“I will try, sir.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>No one can realize how I suffered. I was
not able to work, yet I was forced to do so.
I worried through that day. I could not eat
the poor food that was given us. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
morning came. During the restless night I
had prayed for help from the Spirit World, and
I felt that my prayers were answered.</p>

<p>The guard called: “You, I say, that never
dies, get out here and get your breakfast and
go to work.”</p>

<p>I stood up, and said: “I am ready, sir, but
this morning I am so sick.”</p>

<p>“You eat what you get, and in a hurry too,
for we want to see you at work.”</p>

<p>I obeyed, and was soon on the road to work.</p>

<p>The prison laws were that we were not allowed
to speak to our fellow-men. I watched
my chance to speak, and when opportunity presented,
I said:</p>

<p>“Friend, how long are you here for?”</p>

<p>He did not answer. I thought perhaps he
was hard of hearing, and repeated the words.
He finally looked up and moved his lips. I
knew he had served some time, as he had
learned the sight movement of the lips, and I
did not and could not understand that. I saw
that I was lost, not knowing how to talk in
that way.</p>

<p>The guard said roughly: “You are not
doing much. Here, are you watching for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
opportunity to lay down on me when I am not
looking?”</p>

<p>“I am not, guard. I am doing all I am
able to.”</p>

<p>“I think if you had a day or two rest in
the rest-room it would help you. Come along
here with me.”</p>

<p>The rest-room was a dungeon, dark as night.
When I heard the heavy iron door close after
me, I fell upon my knees and prayed God to
take me from the place of darkness. I was
hungry and cold. All the time I could hear
the words:</p>

<p>“<i>We know you are innocent and will help
you, and you shall be out of this place of unjust
punishment.</i>”</p>

<p>That night—oh, so long! Cold and hungry
I was—I had no bed. The following morning
I was given water and was told to drink and
be merry; yes, to be <em>merry</em>! I wonder if the
outside world could and does believe the stories
of the unfortunate ones who, guilty or not
guilty, have to endure tortures behind prison
walls.</p>

<p>I remained there three days and grew weaker
all the time. Why should I not grow weak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
living on water and darkness and standing up
to sleep?</p>

<p>I was put to work at the same hard labor
which I had performed before. I grew faint
and fell at my post. I lay there when the
guard came upon me. How he did swear! He
clubbed me to my feet and reached out for me.
One jerk from him raised me from my feet.
He had subsisted upon good, substantial food.
I was weak, hungry, and sick.</p>

<p>I was taken to the office for a talk on “the
carpet,” as we called it in prison. As the Power
over all men seemed to look down on me, I
raised my eyes to Heaven and asked for proof
to convince the official that I was an innocent
man. I was hoping against hope for proof, and
I heard a voice say: “Take him out. I will
see what this lady wants.” The official saw
one whom neither the guard nor I saw. I was
led away, back to the dungeon.</p>

<p>Some hours afterwards I was again taken
to “the carpet.” I was praying silently for
proof of my innocence. Again I was told:
“Step aside, for the ladies come first.” Later
I was told of a very mysterious lady who showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
herself unannounced and when she was spoken
to, vanished.</p>

<p>Who could it be? When I was a child, I
often sat with my dear father and mother around
the fireplace and listened with the cold chills
running down my back to stories of ghosts, as
they called them, and how the ghosts would
come and go. No, not where I sat in my dark
dungeon and wondered if that lady could talk,
and, if so, why could she not come to me and
talk to me, as I was all alone. And I again
thought perhaps I would not care to have her
come to me—not as long as I was in the dark
and all alone. But what and who could the
mysterious lady be? I was so interested in our
ghost woman that I forgot my own troubles.</p>

<p>That night, as I was wishing and praying
for morning, and wondering what would be
done with me on “the carpet,” I felt that I
could hardly wait. At last the sun shone on
the prison walls once more, and I was heartily
glad. One more day less of my ten years served.
But there were still years to serve, and with such
treatment and hard labor there was not much
encouragement for a poor convict.</p>

<p>I heard my cell door open. A gruff voice
called to me to step out. I was glad to do so,
and was told to come along.</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">Prison Life.—Mysterious
Influences.</span></h2>

<p>As I was taken through the iron doors I
heard a slam after me. The guard also heard
the same noise. Turning, he called to me to
halt, saying: “What was that?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure, I do not know, sir,” I replied;
“I only heard a noise.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure whether I did or not. I
thought I saw a lady, as I turned my head.”</p>

<p>“Could it be a ghost?” I thought, and, if so,
why was it following me?</p>

<p>“Guard, what is the complaint against this
man?” inquired the superintendent.</p>

<p>“He will not work, sir.”</p>

<p>“Not work? Oh! Well, you have had a
taste of the dungeon, have you not? If that
will not do, we shall have to try some other
means to get you to work, and that will be to
tie your hands above your head until you are
willing to work. How do you think you would
like that?”</p>

<p>“I am willing to work if I had lighter work,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
I said; “I have never had to do such heavy work,
and I am unable to do it.”</p>

<p>“Take him out,” commanded the superintendent,
“and put him on the rack, and when
you feel you can do the work, we will be glad
to take you to your work.”</p>

<p>I did not know what “the rack” meant and
was very willing to follow. To my horror, it
was a place where my hands were tied above
my head. I stood facing the wall. Imagine
the punishment of one fellow-man upon another!
I begged for mercy. All my pleadings
were ignored. When the guard had finished
tying my hands, I was told that he would be
around inside of twenty-four hours, to see if I
had changed my mind.</p>

<p>I knew that I could not stand the punishment long.
I began to pray. I prayed for dear
old mother to come to her helpless and innocent
son. I began to feel the rack quiver. I was
startled. I ceased praying for a moment. I
thought I could feel the clasps move on my
wrists. I was shaken with fear. Was I going
mad, or did I feel the clasps move? To my
great surprise, I was lowered so I could stand
on the bottoms of my feet; before I could touch
only the floor with my toes. I felt a terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
feeling come over me and all was dark. When
I came to myself, I was released. Could the
guard have knocked me senseless? How was
I loosened? I did not see him near me. I did
not feel hurt from any blow. What could have
happened to me! I remained there in a wonderment
of thought as to what could have happened.
About five hours had passed when I
heard footsteps and the guard entered. He was
astonished when he saw that I was loosed.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I am not able to say, sir. Did you not
free my hands?”</p>

<p>“I? No, sir; you know that I did not, and
who did?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. I was praying to my dear
old mother, who died many years ago, to come
to me and help me, as I was innocent of the
crime for which I am being punished, and while
I was praying I felt a dizziness come over me,
and my hands were loosened and I was thrown
to the floor, and when I came to my senses, I
was free.”</p>

<p>“So you think that story will go here, do
you? Well, come along. We shall see if we
can tie you so your prayers will not untie you.”</p>

<p>“My God! do not punish me any more seriously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
I am not deserving of this. I say to
you that I am innocent.”</p>

<p>“We would have no use for the building if
all of you fellows could prove to the world that
you were innocent. If you are not guilty, why
have you been brought here? Surely you had
some justice done you.”</p>

<p>“Sir, I was convicted on circumstantial evidence.
I was not proved guilty, for I am not
guilty. The guilty one is at large, and the
innocent one is here for ten years.”</p>

<p>“You are having your own way about this
argument. I only know you are here for murder,
and it is my duty to see that you are working
for the next ten years. Come along with
me.”</p>

<p>I was taken to “the carpet” and the look
of the officer and higher official was like daggers.
I trembled from head to foot.</p>

<p>“You here again? What is the trouble,
guard?”</p>

<p>“I found this man standing with hands untied
when I entered the rack.”</p>

<p>“What does this mean? Who untied you?”</p>

<p>I saluted the superintendent, and replied:
“I do not know.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will see if we can find out. Take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
him back and double-tie his hands. Strap his
feet also, and tip-toe him, and perhaps he will
be willing to work by and by.”</p>

<p>I began to beg. How could anyone punish
his brother man so? I said:</p>

<p>“I am human and have feeling. I do not
deserve such hard treatment. I would work
willingly if you would give me work that I can
do. I can not do hard labor—I never did.”</p>

<p>“You will do what we see fit to give you
to do, and if you are not willing, you go back
to the rack.”</p>

<p>I could not stand the ordeal. On bended
knees I begged for mercy, and the mercy shown
me was a clubbing, and I was marched back
to the rack.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, I will strap you, as I was ordered
to do, and I will be around, perhaps, to see the
other fellow untie you.”</p>

<p>As before, I was strapped with uplifted
hands, and drawn from the floor to the tips of
my toes. I was exhausted with fear, and as
I was being tied, both feet together, I cried out:
“God, have pity! Give me help and strength
to stand this, for Thou, O Heavenly Father,
dost know that I am innocent.”</p>

<p>I heard the heavy iron door close behind me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
as I thought, for the last time. I could not
see how I could ever withstand this punishment.</p>

<p>Suddenly I began to experience the peculiar
feeling of dizziness that had come over me before.
I felt my hands being loosened, then I
knew nothing more. I lay I do not know how
long. The first I remembered was when I again
heard the door slam and over me stood the
guard and the superintendent. I was told to
get up. I obeyed, and the look on the faces of
those men I shall never forget.</p>

<p>After I was questioned as to how I felt, the
dizziness began again to come upon me. I was
again taken back to “the carpet,” but this time
with more of the feeling of sympathy than
before.</p>

<p>“I am at a loss, sir, to know what to do
with you,” said the superintendent. “I think
that I shall have an investigation of your case
and see if we can find why and what power you
have, if any. I was an eye-witness to your
being untied this time, and no one assisted.
Invisible power is the only explanation I can
make.”</p>

<p class="caption">“THE FIRST I REMEMBER WAS WHEN I AGAIN
HEARD THE DOOR SLAM, AND OVER ME STOOD THE
GUARD AND THE SUPERINTENDENT.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Again I was taken back, but not to the
rack—to my cell, where I was given some coffee,
and kind words with it. I was wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
what this meant when I heard footsteps, then
voices saying:</p>

<p>“<i>Let them tie you as often as they will. I
shall free you. You are innocent, and shall not
be punished.</i>”</p>

<p>I looked for the one whose voice I heard,
and, to my surprise, could not see anyone. I
shuddered. I did not understand this.</p>

<p>I had drunk my coffee, and was feeling
somewhat better from its effect and that of the
kind words, when the superintendent entered
with others.</p>

<p>As I arose to greet them I was drawn back
by some invisible power. Remaining seated, I
was told to arise. I could not do so, and replied
that I could not.</p>

<p>One of the gentlemen seized my arm and
told me to stand up. I tried to do so, and could
not. I was taken hold of by another and told
to stand, but again I could not. Then they
tried to lift me up, and they could not move me.</p>

<p>I became alarmed. I did not feel ill—only
slightly dizzy.</p>

<p>They debated as to what they should do
about my case. I could not understand such
a mystery. I only knew that I was freed, by
whom I could not tell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The mystery was growing in my mind. As
I was sent for by the doctor, whom they called
in to diagnose my case, I arose without effort,
to the surprise of the guard, and walked unassisted
to the office. There I confronted the
doctor, apparently a well man, on my feet, and
feeling well anyway.</p>

<p>I was thoroughly examined, and pronounced
physically well. Once more I was taken back
to “the carpet,” and was told that I would be
given lighter work, and to try not to be subject
to any such treatment hereafter, as disobedient
prisoners have to be compelled to work.</p>

<p>I was taken to the library, and told to book
out all literature, as called for. I became very
much interested in the work and was trying to
make the best of it. I thought: “I am going
to see if I can find some literature in here which
will comfort me and help me to pass this long
time which I must spend inside of these prison
walls.”</p>

<p>I had an order for a book called “The Ghost
of a Woman.” Ghost of a woman! I wondered
if the prisoner who ordered it had seen
the ghost of this woman talked of in this place
and hoped to find a book telling what her mission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
is here, I thought: “I too should like
to know.”</p>

<p>As I was tracing along the line of literature
I was confronted with a book entitled “The
Wisdom.” What could that be? We all needed
some of that, I especially. If I had had more,
I would not be here. “As it is, I am here,” I
thought, “and I am willing to find wisdom.”</p>

<p>I laid the book aside to take along with me
to my cell to read when I should have the opportunity.
I then continued the search for
“The Ghost of a Woman.”</p>

<p>As the guard entered he said: “Well, you
are not making much headway getting out those
orders.”</p>

<p>“I have an order here for a book entitled
‘The Ghost of a Woman.’”</p>

<p>“Here, we have a real live ghost, in here, of
a woman, and that is enough ghost. Let me
see who has left that crazy order. What! The
superintendent wants this book. Well, look it
up. I guess he has not had enough, but I have.
I do not have to read of her, for I see her
times enough.”</p>

<p>I was left to continue the search for the
ghost book. At last I found a similar title and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
laid the book aside. I would perhaps find the
desired book in my search for other literature.</p>

<p>All orders filled, I began to deliver to each
prisoner’s cell. We were allowed light to read
by, two hours each night. I passed these two
hours much more pleasantly with my book of
wisdom than I could have done otherwise. Did
I find wisdom? Do we all find it when we need
it most? Some of us do not. It was so in my
case. I got my wisdom after I could do no
good with it, only to look forward ten years.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">The Ghost of a Woman.</span></h2>

<p>I was told on the following morning, by the
guard, that I would have to leave the library
and do some printing.</p>

<p>“Printing! Dear sakes alive, man, I am no
printer!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Those are the orders,” he replied. “Obey
your orders.”</p>

<p>“I am very willing to do so if I knew how,”
I said.</p>

<p>“I see that you have been reading a book,
here, called ‘Wisdom.’ You should be able to
do something.”</p>

<p>“If I had all the wisdom in my head that
is in that book, I should not be here.”</p>

<p>“You are debating the question too long.
Come along here, sir.”</p>

<p>I was taken to the printing quarters and
given instructions as to what to do. To my
surprise, the part to which I was assigned I
could very easily handle. A prisoner said:</p>

<p>“I am here to give you instructions how to
prepare what we call ‘<cite>The Daily Press</cite>’—news,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
something for the prisoners to read, that they
may know what goes on inside these walls that
will be of benefit to them. We have some good
men here. They are not all criminals because
sent here. Some from misfortune, others from
circumstantial evidence, which later is proven.
I am always glad to see an innocent man
found so. I am speaking in behalf of myself,
here for another’s crime. To make the best of
it is all that I can do, as do many others, who
are here as innocent as I am.”</p>

<p>I could not speak. I felt as if I were choking
with sympathy for that poor chap. I too was
serving a sentence for another’s crime. I am
not sure but that his number was on the order
for a book entitled “I Am Innocent of Crime,”
a book to be found on the shelves of the prison
library.</p>

<p>I felt that I could work by the side of this
fellow-man—this prisoner—more cheerfully, as
he had authority to talk so as to be able to give
instructions to inexperienced help.</p>

<p>I was told to prepare an article for <cite>The
Press</cite>, on how to use power to control yourself
as well as others. I was very willing to do
what I could. That is all anyone can do—the
best we can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>I have been in the presence of men to whom
I could not talk as freely as I should like to,
and in the presence of others to whom I could
talk fast enough. Those to whom one can not
talk freely have a higher power over one, and
those to whom one can talk freely are the persons
over whom one has power. Who has not
had the power experience? When we come in
touch with those with whom we can not talk
freely, it is power over each other. I am leading
out to the power we can not resist. What
is that? I am able to say that I could not
resist going into that house where a crime was
committed to see what the trouble was with
the poor lady who was murdered—murdered,
and I accused of the crime!</p>

<p>I was wondering what my fellow-man under
whose instructions I was placed was there for,
and I became so deep in thought that I was
spoken to by him:</p>

<p>“Well, you must have your work done for
<cite>The Press</cite>, and time for the press to start is
soon at hand.”</p>

<p>“I was so deep in thought I forgot myself,
sir. I beg your pardon. I will try not to let
that happen again.”</p>

<p>At that moment the guard stepped in. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
was accosted in such a brutal way that my
fellow-prisoner interceded for me and asked the
guard to have mercy on me.</p>

<p>“I am quite sure that the man will do all
he can,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, he will when he is driven to it. He
has caused us trouble from the day he landed
here.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, guard. If I could have complied
with your rules and work, I should have
been glad to do so; but I was not able to do the
hard labor you asked me to do.”</p>

<p>“Was it hard work to strangle a poor woman
to death? You found that a very easy job,
did you not?”</p>

<p>“Man, I can not stand it to be accused of
a crime I did not commit!” At that moment
I gave way to my feelings and cried out: “O
Father in Heaven, can not I prove my innocence?”</p>

<p>I found myself lying on my cot when revived.
I knew not what had happened. I
could remember the conversation and nothing
more after that until the present time.</p>

<p>I was in a dazed condition and had the
feeling that someone was near and could see
me. I was taken back to the printer’s shop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and must say that the instructor seemed to
have a cold feeling for me. I said:</p>

<p>“I notice that you are not quite so friendly
as before. Have I offended you?”</p>

<p>“I have no use for a murderer, sir, and especially
for one who murders a helpless woman.”</p>

<p>“I say to you, kind fellow-prisoner, that I
am innocent.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I have your reputation from the
guard. Now, you get to hard work here, and
no more of your pleading innocence.”</p>

<p>“I am going to do all that I can, sir, and as
well as I can, to please you.”</p>

<p>I continued to prepare the press work. I
wrote of the way to live and live right. We
all make mistakes. Some repent, others never
do. Who has not made mistakes which he
would, if he could, undo? I wrote:</p>

<p>“O dear fellow-prisoners, we have all made
mistakes. If we had not, we would not be
here.”</p>

<p>As those words were for <cite>The Press</cite>, the prisoner’s
daily paper, I thought them very appropriate.
As I left for lunch I noticed the man
who was so indifferent before. He stopped to
see what my subject was. I could not help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
but see a change in his manner toward me;
he acted in a more brotherly way.</p>

<p>As I was locked in for the night I was tired
and sick—heart-sick. I could not see, for the
life of me, how I could stand many years of
prison life. At last I closed my eyes for the
night—a long, dark, dreaming one. When a
child I ofttimes sat at my mother’s knee, before
I was sent to bed, and was taught my prayers;
to ask Our Father in Heaven to watch over me.
The next day I knelt and prayed as I had long
years ago for my dear old mother, and asked
God to help me the following day.</p>

<p>Somehow I felt better after I prayed. Eight
o’clock was the hour for work to begin, and I
was somewhat encouraged that morning. I
knew not why. Perhaps the kindness which
was shown me by my fellow-prisoner the day
before was what lightened my heart.</p>

<p>The day’s work had begun when I was
spoken to by a gruff voice, and told that I was
wanted at the office.</p>

<p>My heart was crushed. I thought perhaps
I was to undergo some painful ordeal, as heretofore.
I could not keep up courage to get to
the office. I was trembling with fear when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
entered. I did not ask what I was wanted for.
I felt that I should know soon enough.</p>

<p>Suddenly the officer looked up and smiled. I
did not understand the meaning and remained
silent. He then spoke as if I were a guest
instead of a prisoner:</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I have some work for you to do.
I want to find out who the lady is I see here
and don’t see here, although I hear her voice,
and she seems to be calling your name. Do
you or can you explain the mystery?”</p>

<p>At that moment I could not speak. After
a few moments, I tried to answer in this way:</p>

<p>“I am not able to give any information
whatever. I know not whom you see or hear.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, can you account for your mysterious
freedom from the rack?”</p>

<p>“I am not able to do so.”</p>

<p>“Neither can I, and I sat there and watched
you being untied. Did you ever hear your
dear old friends tell of ghosts?”</p>

<p>“I hear this is a ghost doing this.”</p>

<p>“I am not able to say.”</p>

<p>“Neither am I.”</p>

<p>“Well, do you think you could find out if
it were one?”</p>

<p>“I could not say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am going to have you remain in this
office a few days and see if you can see what
I do. I am not going to have you do anything,
only look and listen.”</p>

<p>“Sir, I am not a coward, but I would prefer
to work, as I am becoming used to hard labor
and would like to keep busy.”</p>

<p>“I think you will find this job hard enough,
and it will keep you busy enough—or, at least,
I have been pretty busy holding myself in here.
I feel I need my vacation now.”</p>

<p>What was I to do? I was trembling from
head to foot, and looking on all sides of me for
the ghost. Presently the door opened. I collapsed
and was deathly faint, when I found it
was only a man.</p>

<p>“I have made arrangements for the prisoner
to remain here in the office with me. His place
may be filled by another,” said the officer to
the man.</p>

<p>“I am glad to stay in here with you,” I
said. “What shall I do?” I trembled so that
my voice quivered.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I am going to let you take that
comfortable chair and sit there for a time, while
I am busy.”</p>

<p>I was seated presently. I felt my chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
move. I moved also, and I cried out: “I am
going mad!” I was being moved in my chair.</p>

<p>“That is nothing, sir. You perhaps will be
moved as often as I have been, and that is
many times.”</p>

<p>I knew not what to do. I could not disobey
orders, but felt that I could no longer
remain there. While debating whether to sit
down or stand up, I was confronted by the
form of a woman.</p>

<p>I fell back and cried out: “Mother! mother!
mother!”</p>

<p>When I became able to speak again, I told
that it was my dear old mother, and I was
asked to describe her, which I did.</p>

<p>“Well, there are two ghosts here, then,” said
the officer; “for that is not the description of
the one I saw.”</p>

<p>Was I to go through with another experience
of seeing another ghost? I fell on my knees
and begged to be sent back to the printing shop.</p>

<p>“You are doing more good here than any
place in which I have placed you. I think you
have a good, long job here—or, at least, until
we find out what the mysterious lady wants
around here.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to be with you, but you are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
giving me any punishment of hard labor, as the
judge said you should.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. Perhaps you have
not worked at this long enough to find the
hard part of it.”</p>

<p>What should I say next to find some excuse
to get away from there? I had thought of all
excuses, and presently I began to feel sick, or
pretended so. Oh, how I did moan! I did
not create any sympathy. The officer informed
me that he had to moan louder than that when
they got after him.</p>

<p>I got well the next breath. What to try
next I did not know. I could not break away
from prison. Soon I heard footsteps. I looked,
but could see no one. I asked the officer if he
heard anything.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I hear them. You are not frightened,
are you? Well, I have become used to
them, and you will if you stay here a few days.”</p>

<p>“Man, I will die if I have to remain in this
office another day!”</p>

<p>“I have felt as you do, and I have had the
same experience ever since you came to this
prison. And your name is repeated many times
a day. Can you explain what all this means?”</p>

<p>“I am an innocent man charged with murder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
done by another. I am not treated justly. That
is all I can say or know. I do not know anything
about these voices or mysterious women,
but I am quite sure that I saw my dear old
mother, as she was when living. I do not understand
it. I am told that we never die. To
explain further I am not able, but I do want
to get out of this office. I feel strong enough
to do any kind of hard work.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I am glad that we have found a
way to make you work, and you may go back
to hard labor.”</p>

<p>The guard was called and orders given to
take the prisoner back to hard labor—not the
printing shop, as he was willing to do hard work.</p>

<p>“You may try to lift some of those anvils
which we have orders to ship. It requires three
or four men to get them where we can load
and ship.”</p>

<p>Could I do what required the strength of
three or four men?</p>

<p>“You may come along here.”</p>

<p>As I was leaving for the shipping yards I
felt that I was accompanied by others beside
my guard, but I could see no one. Presently
we confronted the place of shipping, and I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
shown what was to be done. I looked at the
guard, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Man, do you expect me to load those heavy
irons on the truck?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do not think that your expectations
will be granted. I am not a giant, and
neither am I a myth. I am only a man, as
you are.”</p>

<p>“I did not bring you over here to argue
that question. What you must do is do the
best that you can and try to load up.”</p>

<p>“I will not disobey orders, but I do not see
or understand why I should be asked to do
such hard work—why the work of two or three
men should be placed on one.”</p>

<p>Once more I felt that I could not get courage
to try. I could hear someone say:</p>

<p>“<i>We will help you.</i>”</p>

<p>I looked for someone, as before, but no one
was near.</p>

<p>“Well, if you are going to work, do so at
once.”</p>

<p>I bent over to make an attempt to satisfy
my guard. As I did so I received help, and
behold, I could feel the iron move! I was horrified,
but I saw that I was moving it along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
toward the truck, and that without strain or
great effort on my part.</p>

<p>As the guard saw the great load moving he
called out: “You are moving it! Be careful,
be careful!”</p>

<p>I could hear the sound of someone breathing
heavily. I put the load down and turned to
see if I had help. As I looked for the guard,
to my surprise, he was lying on the floor near
by. I stepped over and spoke to him. He
did not answer. I called out to him to speak
to me. No answer. The shipping space was
off to itself, and at that moment there was no
one near. I could not think what to do. I
could see at once that I would be accused of
harming or killing him, as he lay apparently
dead.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">Accused of Murder.</span></h2>

<p>I thought of the other wrong accusation of
murder. Now, perhaps, it would happen again.
I finally decided to call for help. An officer
stepped up. When he saw his fellow-officer lying
as I have said, apparently dead, he at once
accused me.</p>

<p>“What have you done to this man?”</p>

<p>“I am innocent of any harm to that man.
I did not even see him fall.”</p>

<p>“What were you doing that you did not see
him fall?”</p>

<p>“I, sir, was doing what he told me to do—loading
those pieces of iron on the truck. I
heard deep breathing and turned to look, and
found him as you see him now.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do not believe one word you have
told me, and more, no sane man would ask
another to do what it would require three or
four strong men to do.”</p>

<p>“I was not only asked to do so, but I was
doing it. I had moved the iron to the distance
you see, from the remainder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now you come along. I will send the hospital
word about him.”</p>

<p>Again I was taken to the office. I wondered
what would be done now. As I had no way of
proving that I did not commit the deed, I could
not make them understand that I had not
harmed the guard.</p>

<p>The officer said: “I will tell you. I found
the guard lying on the floor. I do not know
if he is dead or in a faint. I do know that he
looks very much like a dead man.”</p>

<p>“What! Do you mean to tell me that this
man has committed another murder?”</p>

<p>“I am not a murderer, and I did not harm
this man. I did not, I say, and God is my
judge.”</p>

<p>“We shall have to take some unusual proceedings
with you. I am sure that when we
find out the truth, which I hope and pray to do,
and we will if this man is not dead and he tells
the story of how he was harmed, we will be
able to at least see what and why so much
mystery surrounds you.”</p>

<p>“I hope he may live and be able to tell the
story, for I am anxious to find out how he
happened to be in the condition found.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you quite sure that you do not already
know?”</p>

<p>“I do not, sir.”</p>

<p>“I am at a loss to know what to do with
you and where next to place you. Do you think
that you could prove to us that you did move
the iron?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, sir. I am quite sure that
it moved, and I did not see anyone near, and
that is why I stopped when I heard the moaning—to
see what was wrong, and I saw my
guard lying on the floor.”</p>

<p>“You tell a very plain story, but can we
believe it? I can not, and will try you out
again on the same work.”</p>

<p>To the other guard he said: “You may
take him back and see if what he has been
telling is true.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I beg you not to try my strength on
what would require three times the amount of
strength I have, and perhaps cause another circumstantial
evidence of murder, if the guard
should be found dead, after reaching the hospital.”</p>

<p>“I shall not expect you to do so much. I
want you to substantiate the story you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
telling us. And now you may go back to the
shipping quarters.”</p>

<p>I was taken, this time accompanied by the
officer to whom I was talking and who was giving
orders to place me where I should be given
the work.</p>

<p>I thought, on the way back, that I should
fall with fear and weakness. I could not see
how I could have courage to try to move the
unreasonable load again.</p>

<p>We are shown no mercy in prison—at least,
I was not. Instead, I was bidden to do work
which it was impossible for me to do, outside
of prison walls. We accomplish a great many
feats through fear. I am sure that I could not
accomplish many which I did except through
fear.</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” said the officer, “you say that
you moved that iron that distance?”</p>

<p>“I did, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, you may now show if you can move
it as far, again, and I shall see that while you
are moving it you do not move me too, as you
did the other, to the hospital.”</p>

<p>At that moment I could not speak. Instead
I could hear someone speak to me, and the
words were:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>I will help you. Take hold.</i>”</p>

<p>I did so. As I bent over I could see several
trying to get hold of the anvils. I felt that my
strength was greater than ever before, and I
could see the anvils move along, apparently with
ease. After I had moved them to where we
wished them to be, I raised up and found that
I was all alone. I looked around for the officer
and guard, but they were not to be seen.</p>

<p>As I was standing meditating as to what
I should do, a prisoner all alone with no guard
in sight, I wondered if I should call for a guard,
or try to move another mass of iron.</p>

<p>At that moment a voice called to me. Turning
to look, I was confronted by a new guard,
whom I had never before seen. We could readily
tell the guards by their uniforms.</p>

<p>“How does it come,” he said, “that you are
outside of your rank and here doing nothing
with no guard near?”</p>

<p>“Sir, I am here working and had a guard
with me.”</p>

<p>“Well, where is he now?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, sir. While I was lifting
these anvils and placing them where we could
load them for shipment, he disappeared.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go on! What are you giving me? You
alone lifting these anvils?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you know that you are not strong
enough to lift one end of any one of them, not
even the smallest-sized one there?”</p>

<p>“Well, I do not understand, myself, how
I did it, but I did.”</p>

<p>“I think that I shall have to take you to
‘the carpet.’ You are astray from work in
some part of this prison.”</p>

<p>Dear, oh, dear! Back to “the carpet”! On
the way I could hear a hearty laughing, and I
felt that I was being ridiculed by my fellow-men,
because I was taken so often to the so-called
“carpet.” As we knew, usually when
an officer was taking a prisoner to the office
many times, he was sent for as a punishment
for disobeying. In another moment I thought
I could not have heard the prisoners laugh, as
that was against the rules. Then what did I
hear?</p>

<p>We at last reached the office, only to find
the superintendent gone, the door locked, and
no way of getting in, as the door of the office
leads inside of the prison walls. Therefore it
is necessary to have locked doors at all times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The next thing to do with me was to lock
me in my cell, as I could not make the officer
believe that I was working when he found me.</p>

<p>After some time in my cell I was again sent
for, this time by a new guard, and was told to
go to the office with him.</p>

<p>As we entered I saw several men whom I
had never before seen in the office. I noticed
that they were officers of the prison. They
seemed to be very much excited, and I must
say that I too was excited. I did not know
what next they would or could do with me.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">Official Excitement.</span></h2>

<p>I was told to be seated. As I turned to
the empty chair I was not permitted to sit
down. I could not do so. I tried as hard as
I could, but I did not move. Again I was
spoken to, and told to be seated. This time
the voice that commanded me to be seated was
gruff and harsh.</p>

<p>I replied: “I am trying to, sir, but I can
not move.”</p>

<p>“You sit down. We are going to find out
what is wrong with you. I have called in all
the higher officers, and we intend to have your
case thoroughly investigated this day.”</p>

<p>All this time I did not move—I could not,
and presently I heard a voice say:</p>

<p>“<i>Do not sit down. We will not allow you to
do so.</i>”</p>

<p>Suddenly I was seized by the officer, and
was again told to sit down.</p>

<p>I said: “I would obey if I could, but I
can not move.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will move you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>I could see that the officer made an effort
to compel me to move, and I could feel myself
grow rigid. Presently I felt myself begin to
move toward the door of the inside prison, and
for a moment everything seemed dark. I felt
a sickening feeling come over me. I began to
lose consciousness, and found myself sitting on
the chair against the prison door. All the officers
were lying on the floor. I cried out for help.</p>

<p>“Come to my rescue!” I cried. “I have
not harmed anyone here.”</p>

<p>At that moment guards came from all directions,
and shouted: “Open the door!” I could
not and did not move.</p>

<p>Again they shouted, and I did not move. I
did not look like a dead man, sitting there, but
I must frankly say that I felt like one, and if
wishes could have been granted, would have
been one, for I was in prison for one murder,
perhaps two, and from the surroundings it might
be several, as these men all looked like corpses
to me.</p>

<p>Presently “Bang!” went the door. The
guards had gotten great heavy irons and were
trying to force the door open. When they succeeded,
I was the first one to be taken care of.
As a matter of fact, the dead men, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
thought them, could be gotten away in only
one way, and that is carried. I could get away,
but did not have a chance. But I got something
else, a good beating from the officers.</p>

<p>Oh, how I did beg and try to explain to
them that I had not harmed anyone! but in
vain. I was laid up for some time from the
severe treatment.</p>

<p>I knew not what became of the officials, or
how badly, if at all, they were hurt. Neither
did I know how it happened that they were
all lying so helpless on the floor.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate for me, as they did not
know of this mysterious power nor of the “lady
ghost”—so called, nor of the unseen power which
had put our friend in the hospital. He had
recovered enough to take notice when the officers
were brought into the hospital. He naturally
inquired if there had been a prison raid,
and the answer was:</p>

<p>“More serious than that. We would be glad
to let some of our prisoners go if we could do
so, as they seem to do much as they please
with themselves and others too. The great
mystery is causing much trouble, and we can
not find out what is wrong.”</p>

<p>“How long have I been here and why am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
I here? I am not hurt. I was not attacked
by my prisoner. The last I remember I was
cautioning him to be careful, as I saw him lifting
what no three men could. That is my last
recollection. I have not an ache nor a pain,
and why am I here? Bring the prisoner to me.”</p>

<p>“We can not. He is also in the hospital.
He disobeyed so much that he received such
treatment as to be sent to the hospital.”</p>

<p>“He has! Tell me what has he done?”</p>

<p>“To the best of my knowledge, he has murdered
five of the officials, all brought in here
just now, as you have seen.”</p>

<p>“Murdered! murdered! I want to get to
him.”</p>

<p>“You too have been injured by him, and
you must remain quiet until pronounced out
of danger.”</p>

<p>“I am not injured, and he did not harm me.
I must be taken to the office, that I may declare
this man innocent of that crime.”</p>

<p>“I shall have to have orders from your
physician before I could consider taking you
out of the hospital. I fear that you are not
yourself, when you say that the prisoner did
not harm you.”</p>

<p>“I can swear before all, and by God in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Heaven, that he did not. I must be taken
to him and tell him that I will say that he
did me no harm.”</p>

<p>“You will have plenty of time to prove his
innocence, and tell why you are here and how
you did get hurt if he did not do it.”</p>

<p>“I am not hurt. I am as well as I ever was
in my life, and I must see the doctor and say
to him that I must be out of here.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I will go to the doctor and
send him to you.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">Discharged from the Hospital.</span></h2>

<p>“Good morning, sir,” said the doctor when
he entered. “I was told that you wished to
see me.”</p>

<p>“If it is the rule of this hospital to be discharged
by the doctor, then I want to see you.
Outside of that I do not need you.”</p>

<p>“Are you preparing to leave here?”</p>

<p>“I am. Why should I remain here? I am
not sick.”</p>

<p>“You are not able to leave. I see that you
are in a very dangerous condition.”</p>

<p>“Tell me why you say and think so.”</p>

<p>“I am going to say to you that I have seen
many such cases as yours—delirious. They do
not feel ill and know not what is wrong, and
think they are in the very best of health. I
will take your temperature.”</p>

<p>“One moment, please—”</p>

<p>“Temperature 104. You are a very sick
man. You must remain in this ward.”</p>

<p>“I must save the accused prisoner. He did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
not hurt me. I distinctly remember that I was
saying to him, ‘Be careful!’ and he was not
even looking toward me.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I fear that you do not understand.
I have been attending some of our officials
who have been hurt very badly by the
same prisoner, and we have him in the mad-house,
very dangerously injured by the officer
who found them a few minutes after the act
had been committed, just as you were found,
and he pleaded innocent, just as he did in
your case.”</p>

<p>“I will say to you, and I must say to all
men, that he did not harm me. I am not ill.
I must be discharged from this place.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I will see about it.”</p>

<p>Going to another part of the hospital, where
the other patients who had fallen to the floor
had been taken, the doctor, turning to the
superintendent, said:</p>

<p>“Good morning. You are feeling much better
this morning?”</p>

<p>“I am, sir. I do not feel ill. I am not ill,
and shall leave for the office at once. Why am
I here? I have not been ill. As I awakened
this morning I could not for a moment realize
where I was and what had happened.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you no recollection of any trouble?”</p>

<p>“I do not remember of any. Oh, yes! The
mysterious ghost is all the trouble I have had
for some time. But how is the guard the prisoner
hurt? Is he dead? What have they done
with him? Did I not order him to be brought
in, so that the superior officers might see what
could be done? Oh, I do remember, now! It
was not clear in my mind until now; now it
has begun to clear up so that I can remember.
Pray tell me why you brought me here? I do
not remember of coming. Who is in charge
of the office?”</p>

<p>“An officer is taking care of the office. It
is well cared for.</p>

<p>“I have some mail here. Shall I leave it
at the office, or here?”</p>

<p>“The officer is able to read.”</p>

<p>“You are not to make me sick by saying
these things. I am not sick.</p>

<p>“What have I here? A letter from the murderer
of the mysterious woman ghost! What
does this mean? Listen:</p>

<p>“‘<i>I want to confess. I did the murdering,
and not the prisoner you have there. He is innocent.</i>’</p>

<p>“Well, well! He does not give his name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and I wonder how he knows of a mysterious
ghost, as I have guarded very carefully about
the mystery. I have avoided gossip about the
matter, preferring that it should not get out.
But I should be glad to free the ghost and let
her out. I should be entirely willing if she
would go. When I go to the office, I shall send
for the prisoner whose name I hear called so
much. And I shall show him this letter and
notice if any change comes over him.</p>

<p>“Now I shall leave for the office, and you,
guard, may bring the prisoner numbered 78
there.”</p>

<p>Soon a guard appeared at my side, saying:
“You are wanted at the office. Get up there.”</p>

<p>“I am not able to go. I have been badly
hurt, and I am heart-sick. I know that I can
not live this life any longer.”</p>

<p>“You will not have to, perhaps, if you knew
what I know. You would make an effort to
get up and come along with me,” said the guard.</p>

<p>“<i>The right murderer will be in your place
soon, and you will be out; so collect your strength,
my son, and go. I will help you. I have the
strength to help you and I will do so.</i>”</p>

<p>“I hear someone talking, but I do not see
anyone. Did you hear anyone?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I did. I heard the voice say, ‘Son,
get strength.’ I heard that and more.”</p>

<p>“‘You will be out soon’—did you hear that?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>Once more to “the carpet”—this time with
more hope than before, that the truth would
come out.</p>

<p>On entering I saw that the officer looked pale.
He seemed to be very much worried.</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir. I have a very mysterious
letter here. Can you tell me anything
about it? You may read it.”</p>

<p>I saw the words, “I am the real murderer of
the mysterious woman ghost.” I cried out:</p>

<p>“I prayed to God that the real murderer
would come and acknowledge that he did the
crime, for I knew that I did not, and I know
who did.”</p>

<p>“The name, sir?”</p>

<p>As he wrote it down I could hear a hearty
laugh, and so did he.</p>

<p>“Do not laugh, sir. You are not proved
innocent.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon. I did not laugh.”</p>

<p>“Who did, then?”</p>

<p>“I am not able to say.”</p>

<p>“Officer, take him back. I feel that I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
see if this is a letter written by some crank, or
was it written as a real confession. It is a mystery.
I must say that I think this man is innocent,
and I propose to look into this affair
thoroughly at once. If he is innocent, he must
be released. If not, he must work. I shall
write to the authorities at the place where this
letter was posted and have them make an investigation.
I am of the opinion that this man
is not guilty. As I sit here I know that I am
hearing the words: ‘My son is innocent and
you must release him from this prison.’ Yet
I know that the one whose voice I hear is
invisible.”</p>

<p>A week passed. There had been no answer
from the ones who had been written to in regard
to the prisoner. The superintendent grew
weary of waiting. He felt that there should
have been some reply. He had sent a copy of
the anonymous letter of confession.</p>

<p>A guard appeared, and said: “You have a
very sick man in 78. I have not been able to
arouse him, and I have been working over him
for some time.”</p>

<p>Telling the story afterward, the superintendent
said:</p>

<p>“I looked at the guard, and at that moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
I saw a lady standing beside him. I arose and
asked her: ‘What can I do for you, madam?’</p>

<p>“The guard turned to look as she vanished,
and said: ‘You are mistaken. I brought no
lady here with me.’</p>

<p>“I was so astonished at the remark that I
spoke harshly and demanded the guard to tell
me who the lady was and how she got in, if
he had not admitted her.</p>

<p>“He replied: ‘I am not able to say. I did
not see anyone. I came directly to you and
did not see anyone here, nor did I notice anyone
near as I entered this office.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, what is wrong, now?’</p>

<p>“‘I came to tell you that No. 78 is a very
sick man.’</p>

<p>“‘I suppose he thinks that he will get his
freedom after the reading of the mysterious
letter, but I feel that there is a mystery in connection
with the entire matter. There is not
enough proof to entitle him to his freedom.
Proof of that kind would not go in court—at
least, not in this day and age. If he needs a
doctor, call one.’</p>

<p>“‘I am at a loss to know what to do with
him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“As the guard turned to call a doctor for
the prisoner I heard a voice say:</p>

<p>“‘<i>He is not sick—only resting. He will soon
be out of here.</i>’</p>

<p>“I once more looked to see whence came
the voice. But could gain no information as
to where or from whom the voice came.</p>

<p>“‘I must get away from this place. I am
losing my mind,’ I thought. ‘Perhaps I really
have lost it, for I can not explain these strange
things. I must get away for a day or so. I
will leave the office. Pearson can take care of
this case while I am at rest and thinking this
matter over. I can think it over away from
here.’</p>

<p>“The guard returned in a few minutes,
smiling, and with the news that the prisoner
was sitting up when he arrived with the doctor.
He also said that the prisoner had denied that
anything was the matter with him.</p>

<p>“‘So he has been feigning, has he? Well,
he shall get no more sympathy from this place.
I have decided to rest a few days, and in my
place Mr. Pearson will give orders. But I want
you to cease at once showing mercy on prisoner
No. 78. You may go for Mr. Pearson. I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
leave directions for him to find a place for the
prisoner and see that he works.’</p>

<p>“‘I am not sure, but I think that I saw Mr.
Pearson talking with the man very recently.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, bring him here. I want to talk
with him.’</p>

<p>“I was all a-tremble—just on the verge of
nervous breakdown. All on account of this
mysterious voice and seeing and not seeing.</p>

<p>“‘Good morning, Mr. Pearson,’ I said. ‘I
am leaving for a few days’ rest, and I want you
to take charge of this office and see that a convict
here, No. 78, is put to work. He is very
much averse to doing any work, and we have
no pets in this place, so he can not be made one.
The guard will report to you from time to time
in regard to him.’</p>

<p>“As I was leaving, in an undertone I said:
‘Yes, and if you do not get reports from some
others, as well as the guard, I shall be very
much disappointed. I hope that you will. I
pray that you may, and perhaps I shall have
help to find out what all this means. I hope
that he will be able to explain all the mysterious
actions by the time I return to work.’</p>

<p>“Oh, what a relief it was to know that I was
away from that strain for a while, at least!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The acting superintendent thought: “I am
going to see what the trouble is with No. 78.
I wonder if that is the fellow who has caused
so many mysterious things to happen around
here. By George! I believe it is. I will ask
the guard. Here he comes.”</p>

<p>“Guard, if that 78 prisoner hasn’t any aptitude
for the position he has to occupy, you may
bring him in. I will try to find out what vocation
he has followed, and see if we can accommodate
him.”</p>

<p>As the guard left he shook his head, as if to
say: “You can not have any luck in getting
that fellow to work.”</p>

<p>But the official in his own mind decided:
“My dear old dad has often told me that kind
words will do far more than harsh ones or harsh
treatment. I am going to treat this prisoner
with kindness and gentleness.”</p>

<p>Then the acting superintendent looked up
to see if he had a hard criminal to deal with,
as No. 78 entered the door with his guard. He
sank into his chair, gasping:</p>

<p>“What do I see? My brother! Do my
very eyes deceive me, or is it really he? A
convict in this place!”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smcap smaller">“My Brother a Convict!”</span></h2>

<p>The official thought: “I must not let myself
be known. I must not.”</p>

<p>To the prisoner he said: “You may be
seated, sir. I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>Then to the guard: “I will excuse you,
guard. I wish to question the prisoner alone.”</p>

<p>Turning to the prisoner: “Now, sir, I should
like to hear something about yourself. Why
were you sentenced, and have you registered
under your real name?”</p>

<p>“I have, sir. I am not a criminal. I have
been sentenced because of strong circumstantial
evidence. I am innocent. I did not commit
the crime for which I am here.”</p>

<p>“Well, my opinion of you is good. I do
not believe that you are a murderer—at least,
I hope not. What occupation did you follow
before you came here?”</p>

<p>“I was a follower of any work I could do—anything
that my strength would permit me to
do. I was not a disagreeable man. I made
many friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you had many, your friends were no
help to you in this case. Did not they offer
any assistance?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I was judged wrongly from the
beginning—that is, as soon as it was discovered
that it was my handkerchief which was found
by the dead lady’s side. My friends were nowhere
to be found. I received cold and hard
looks from all.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I have heard your story. I want
to ask you where you were born. What is your
native country?”</p>

<p>“My home, sir, is in England. When a very
small boy, I ran away from home. I have
grieved my dear old mother so much. I understand
that she has since died, and after I heard
that, I never cared to go home again, but I
feel that many times she has spoken to me.
Often, when I have been attracted to company
I did not know well, I could feel that she was
near me and I could hear these words: ‘<i>My
son, be careful, be careful!</i>’ And I did not and
would not go on after getting the warning, as I
called it.”</p>

<p>“You talk as if you had tried to live the
right kind of a life, and I feel that you have,
but in the position which I hold here I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
not show any favors; otherwise I would do so
in this case. Therefore I must give you work
to fit the crime of which you have been accused.
That will mean hard work.”</p>

<p>“I am willing to work, but do not give me
work that my strength will not allow me to do.
I am weak. I do not get the substantial food
that you do, therefore I am not able to work
hard. You do not know what it means to be
punished for a crime committed by another.
I am being punished for a murder which I never
committed, and I ask you to have mercy on me.”</p>

<p>“You are guilty until proved innocent. I
will ring for the guard, and he will place you
where you belong.”</p>

<p>As the guard approached the prisoner turned
and looked in astonishment. The official also
looked, and, describing the scene afterward, he
said:</p>

<p>“I was raised from my chair. I do not
know by what means. Then I began to feel
dizzy and could not speak. I lost my power
to see. I could feel someone near, and then I
heard the voice of a woman saying: ‘<i>You would
sentence your brother to hard labor, to enable you
to hold your own position? You, a child of the
same mother and father? Have you no mercy on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
him? My son, take this brother to your arms and
let yourself be known to him. Look into this affair
and see if he is not innocent. I will release
you, and you do with your brother as you would
have him do to you. These are the commands of
the spirit of your mother.</i>’</p>

<p>“I shall never forget the terrible strain I
was in, and as I mumbled brokenly I felt a
hand trembling, trying to help me to stand up,
and I was given strength by the help of this
hand.</p>

<p>“The guard asked for instructions as to
where he should place this man—my brother,
and I ordered him back to his cell.</p>

<p>“I was at a loss to know what to do. Must
I confess—acknowledge him as my brother? or
should I pretend to be ignorant of the fact which
was plain to my mind? No one knew that he
was my brother—not even the man himself
knew it. Why should I acknowledge a criminal
and a murderer? I could not!</p>

<p>“I thought: ‘I shall place him at once at
hard labor. I shall call the guard and have
him brought in. I shall try to be brave and
not think of boyhood days, when he and I went
hand in hand to the dear old school. And dear
mother, how she caressed us as she said good-bye!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
I can hear those words ring in my ears
yet: “Run along, children, and study hard, and
some day you will be your mother’s pride.”
Yes, to-day, if she could be near her criminal
son, she would not be so proud of him. She
would do as I am going to do, disown him.’</p>

<p>“I had been so deeply engrossed in thought
that I had not called for the prisoner, so I
called: ‘Guard, I want you to bring No. 78
in here.’</p>

<p>“I felt so uneasy that I thought: ‘Can it
be that I have decided wrong in this matter?’</p>

<p>“‘Here he is,’ responded the guard, in a
short time.</p>

<p>“‘Come in, and I will find the work for you
to do which I think you will be able and trustworthy
to do. You may take this coat and
hat, and you may remove your coat of stripes,
and we will exchange places.’</p>

<p>“‘What! You think that I would not do my
part if I were given work which I could do?
I know that I would do my part if given work
I could do. I know I would do my part. Oh,
please give me a chance! I only want an opportunity
to live, if I can, those ten years I must
stay in here—or, at least, until I am proved
innocent.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Well, how do you think you can prove
that you are innocent?’</p>

<p>“‘The real murderer has written to the superintendent
and confessed his guilt—or, at least,
a letter has been sent here stating that I am
innocent.’</p>

<p>“‘You received such a statement?’</p>

<p>“‘I did not, but the officer did—the one
whose place you are filling.’</p>

<p>“‘I will look into this matter, at once.’</p>

<p>“‘You may take him back to his cell, guard,
and I will send for him again when I have investigated
this thoroughly. Take him back, and
return at once.’</p>

<p>“I was sure that if he were innocent, he could
be proved to be so, and I decided to go about
it at once.</p>

<p>“‘A great man, he is,’ said the guard. ‘We
have had more trouble with him than with
twenty-five of the other prisoners together.’</p>

<p>“‘Do you know anything in regard to a
letter written here?’</p>

<p>“‘I do not. I think that the superintendent
has taken a letter for use while he is working
on the case for the poor devil.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, I will go to the records and see if
there is a record of any such letter.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘I hope that you will do something in a
hurry, for I am getting tired of pacing back
and forward with the gentleman,’ said the guard.
‘I feel that I have need of a pair of shoes sot
to going some other direction than from 78’s
cell to the office and back.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, Pat, what is your opinion of this
case? Do you think the man is innocent, or
not?’</p>

<p>“‘I’m not here acting as judge, but if he is
guilty, the mon should work. Setting around
eating of the victuals and his toime going on
just the same!’</p>

<p>“‘The only way to prove his innocence
would be for the poor woman to come back
and tell how the murder was done, and I don’t
think there would be any of us here to do time
or see others did if we would see her here telling
us how she was murdered.’</p>

<p>“‘I, for one, would be a dead Pat.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, Pat, we are both in doubt about
the prisoner’s guilt. Now, as long as he is here
and proved guilty, say we find work for him
to do. What would there be to do where a
man could work and not work?’</p>

<p>“‘Leave him have the same job he has had—rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in his cell when he is not on the road here
and back.’</p>

<p>“‘If you want a job of that kind, you misunderstand
me, Pat. As I understand the poor
man, he has never done very hard manual labor,
and to place him to work of that kind, I fear,
would make it necessary to soon change again.
I am sorry that it had to fall to me to confine
a convict to hard labor and feel that he is innocent
[in an undertone] and my brother!’</p>

<p>“‘Well, shall I bring the poor devil in? My
shoes has pointed that way; every toime I
start the shoes on my very feet wants to track
to 78’s cell.’</p>

<p>“‘I wish we could arrange everything, Pat,
so your shoes could get a rest. It matters not
about our minds. Bring him along.’”</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">The Brother Sentenced to Hard
Labor.</span></h2>

<p>The official continued: “As the man left to
do my bidding I said to myself: ‘He has gone
to bring in my brother for me to sentence to
hard labor. What shall I do? I do not feel
as if I could utter the words.’</p>

<p>“I was completely upset. I experienced a
most peculiar feeling. I thought: ‘Here he
comes. I must do my duty.’</p>

<p>“I said to the prisoner: ‘Come in, sir. And
how do your feel this morning?’</p>

<p>“Now, the devil take the mon who is two-faced!
I brought the prisoner here to be put to
work. Instead of that, he is having a nice
visit with him. Inquiring about his health!’
Pat was heard mumbling to himself.</p>

<p>“‘Well, sir, I am going to see if you can do
the work I will give you to do. I am going to
have you take care of the prisoners in seeing
that they have water to drink. Now, I will
give you instructions. You understand the rules<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of the prison, and I hope that you will abide
by them. Do not speak to any of your fellow-prisoners.
You will be passing back and forth
around each working booth. They understand
how to ask for water, if they wish any.’</p>

<p>“‘Pat, you may show him the way. And
see that you do not burden him with a heavy
load. Now you may go.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, come along here, pet. I will give
you a quart bucket which is light to carry, and
if I happen to be going your way, I will help
you carry it.’</p>

<p>“I hoped that at last we had found a place
which the prisoner could fill. I felt somewhat
at ease. I felt that I had done my duty to my
brother as well as I could under the circumstances.
I hoped that my arrangements would
please him and also please the superior officer
when he returned. And, by the way, it was
time for him to return. I wondered if he had
enjoyed his vacation.</p>

<p>“‘Well, your honor.’</p>

<p>“‘What is it, Pat?’</p>

<p>“‘Your pet has refused to carry a full bucket
of water, and stands there and looks at it as
if he never saw water before. He will not speak
a word. I do believe he is petrified—turned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
one of those things which looks like a man and
is a dead one.’</p>

<p>“‘Pat, I can hardly believe you. I shall
have to see for myself. Close the door behind
us. We can not leave it unlocked to tempt
our prisoners.</p>

<p>“‘You are falsifying, Pat. Is not that the
fellow, going there with that bucket of water?’</p>

<p>“‘To be sure it is.’</p>

<p>“‘Then why did you come to me with such
reports?’</p>

<p>“‘I came with the truth, your honor, and
if the man can be dead one minute and alive
the next, then I want to deal with the live ones
all the toime.’</p>

<p>“‘You perhaps do not understand how to
handle him.’</p>

<p>“‘And faith, I think the majority of them
is in the same fix. They have had the same
experience themselves.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, as long as everything is all right, we
will try and rest easy.’</p>

<p>“‘You are resting easy now. But when the
superintendent comes back and finds that when
he has left orders to punish a convict you favor
him, I think you will have to find yourself
another job.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“When the superintendent entered, I experienced
a feeling of relief. I exclaimed: ‘Well,
well! Back, and looking fine. I was thinking
of you this morning, hoping that you were having
a good rest.’</p>

<p>“‘I did not rest much, for reasons that I
will explain. I have here a letter, which I received
before I left. It purports to have been
written by the murderer for whom No. 78 is
serving time.’</p>

<p>“‘You have such a letter? But why do
you look so excited?’</p>

<p>“‘Have you had any trouble with the prisoner?’</p>

<p>“‘Well, yes and no.’</p>

<p>“‘What is the trouble? You answer me
both ways.’</p>

<p>“‘I have placed him to work, and after I
had done so I was informed that he refused
to work. I was anxious to see for myself, and
when I went to investigate, I found him doing
his duty. Therefore that is why I answered
you as I did.’</p>

<p>“‘To hard labor, as I instructed you to do?’</p>

<p>“‘Well, yes, hard labor for him, as he explained
that he had never done any hard labor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
I hope that you will be pleased with the work
I have given him to do.’</p>

<p>“‘And what work has he been instructed
to do?’</p>

<p>“‘I have given—well, I thought he could be
very useful in doing such work as that, and I
asked Pat to start him at once.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, yes; I think that is a good job. Call

who will tell the truth.’</p>

<p>“‘You are very nervous. I have noticed
your peculiar actions ever since we began to
talk of this affair.’</p>

<p>“‘Good mornin’, your honor. I am very
glad to see that you have returned.’</p>

<p>“‘I am glad to be here. Pat, what has
become of No. 78? Is he working? I hope
to have some knowledge of him when you have
finished talking. I have not been able to find
out much through Mr. Pearson, here.’</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I am only here to do as directed,
and I follow instructions to the letter, and if
I am told to go out and bate a fellow to death,
I would do it, so in this case I did as I was
instructed to do.’</p>

<p>“‘You are a noble officer, sir. I think you
have been requested to tell me what has become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of No. 78. As yet you have not followed your
instructions.’</p>

<p>“‘I will bring the rascal in here and let him
tell you what he is doing.’</p>

<p>“‘Is he running at large, doing nothing?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir, and has the privilege of carrying
some water along to take a drink when he gets
thirsty.’</p>

<p>“‘Bring him here. I will try to find out
from him what orders have been given him.</p>

<p>“‘I am going to see if I can solve this mystery.
Mr. Pearson, are you ill? You are looking
very pale. Do you feel ill? What is the
matter? Are you faint?</p>

<p>“‘Come along, Pat, step lively. Bring your
prisoner in, and call Doctor Gray. Mr. Pearson
is very ill.’</p>

<p>“The prisoner entered, saying: ‘I am so
glad to see you here and see you looking so
refreshed.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, I think I shall hold my fresh looks
a long time here and have a myth, like you, to
deal with.’</p>

<p>“‘I beg your pardon, sir, I have not caused
you any trouble. I am not disobeying the
rules. I never have.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘You are doing what now?’</p>

<p>“‘I am carrying water for my fellow-prisoners
to have a drink, as they need water so often.’</p>

<p>“‘Come in, doctor. I have a patient here
for you. Mr. Pearson is very ill.’</p>

<p>“At that moment I lost consciousness.”</p>

the Mystery.</span></h2>

<p>“Mr. Pearson has fainted. I have just returned
from my vacation. Please get some water.
I think it is nothing serious.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand the case. His pulse
is normal. His temperature is not high enough
to indicate extreme illness. Yet he seems to be
in a very deep faint. You had better call another
doctor. I am at a loss to know what
to do.”</p>

<p>“I will ring for one at once. Here is Pat.
I’ll send him for Doctor Simson.</p>

<p>“Pat, go at once and bring Doctor Simson.
We are not able to bring Mr. Pearson to.”</p>

<p>Pat was heard mumbling to himself: “Another
mysterious case. I’m going to leave this
prison, and I would not blame the others if
they did the same, prisoners and all.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Simson, you are wanted at once, at the
main office. The officer, Mr. Pearson, is a dead
man—or, at least, he looks it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Pat, if he is dead, there is no use in
my going.”</p>

<p>“You better go and see for yourself. There
are some funny doings going on around here.
Men look like dead ones, and not dead. I hope
I won’t be looking like a dead one and disappointing
my friends. You must be coming along.
They sent me for a doctor, and, faith, I would
bring you at once.”</p>

<p>“Well, Pat, I am ready. So your patient
looks like a dead one, hey?”</p>

<p>“You may decide that for yourself when
you get there.”</p>

<p>“Well, here we are. I shall soon see.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Officer. What have
we here? A sick man?”</p>

<p>“Good morning, doctor.”</p>

<p>“Doctor, what would you do in a case like
this? I am not able to tell what is wrong.”</p>

<p>“Have you taken his temperature?”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“And what is it?”</p>

<p>“Normal.”</p>

<p>“In so dead a faint, and normal?”</p>

<p>“You may take his temperature and see if
I am mistaken.”</p>

<p>“You are right, doctor. The best thing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
do is to let the patient rest a few moments. I
see no serious danger. I do not really understand
the case.”</p>

<p>“Pat, you may bring in the stretcher and
we will take him to the hospital.”</p>

<p>“I have been set to carrying the dead to
the cemetery when they could not speak any
more.”</p>

<p>“You are having some trouble with one of
your prisoners here, I understand.”</p>

<p>“We are, doctor, and here he is.”</p>

<p>“He does not look like a sickly man, but,
my dear sir, you can not always tell by looking
at a man what strength he has.”</p>

<p>The prisoner interposed: “I am not a strong
man, doctor, but I am strong enough to work
if I were given work that I could do.”</p>

<p>“We have placed him in many places, and
we have not been able to find out what he
can do.”</p>

<p>“I am doing all that is required of me, am I
not, at the last work you have given me to do?”</p>

<p>“You are, as far as I know, but you were
sentenced here to hard labor. I must obey the
orders of the courts.”</p>

<p>“What is the poor man here for? He talks
as if he were a good sort of a fellow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Murder. Does that sound as if he were a
good fellow? And a poor woman, at that—strangled
her to death. A horrible death.”</p>

<p>At that moment a voice was heard saying:
“<i>You are accusing him wrongfully. He is not
a murderer.</i>”</p>

<p>Turning to look for the speaker, they were
surprised to see Mr. Pearson ready to speak.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, you have recovered. How do
you feel?”</p>

<p>“I have not been ill.”</p>

<p>“Well, we have been very busy for the last
half-hour, trying to get you to speak.”</p>

<p>“Pat, you may take the stretcher back. The
patient will be able to walk to the hospital if
he needs to go.”</p>

<p>“The way these fellows have of dying and
coming to life again must be a trade they have
learned.”</p>

<p>“Are you not going to let me work, sir, at
what I was last given to do?”</p>

<p>“You are going to hard labor. No more of
this playing off around here.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that you need my services
any longer,” said the doctor. “The officer seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
all right, and he says that he is. I shall return
to the hospital.”</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Pearson,” said the superintendent,
“please explain to me—when orders were
given to put this man to hard work, you gave
him a trusty job.”</p>

<p>“I did the best I could. I am not a heartless
man. The poor fellow said he could not
do hard manual labor, and I believe he told the
truth, and I am willing to give him a trial, for
proof of his honesty.”</p>

<p>“You know of all the crimes he has committed
while in here, do you not? Or, at least,
tried to and failed.”</p>

<p>“In what way, pray tell me?”</p>

<p>“Trying to murder the guards. I, for one,
had a peculiar experience with him. Found
myself in the hospital—fortunately, not hurt,
however, but not able to explain what had
happened.”</p>

<p>“Now you will have to work, sir, and I am
going to call Pat. I can trust him to see that
you do.</p>

<p>“Pat, take this fellow to the booth where
they prepare iron for shipping, and see that he
works. And I shall assign you, Pat, to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
care of him, and him alone. We shall see if
this mystery can be cleared up.”</p>

<p>“Come along with me, pet 78. I will make
a sure enough dead one out of you if you trifle
with me. When I have instructions to do anything,
I generally do it.”</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Pearson, I shall have to reprimand
you. You are working under my instructions.
I, bear in mind, hold a higher position
over you, and you will have to explain to me
the whys and wherefores of what you did, as
you did not follow my directions.”</p>

<p>“I followed your instructions, sir, the best
I could, after Pat spoke of a letter which was
received here by you, written as a confession
of the crime for which this poor fellow was
doing time.”</p>

<p>“So your sympathies got such a hold over
you that you use the expression ‘poor fellow,’
do you? My opinion is that the letter was a
hoax to get sympathy for him while here. It
was probably written by some friend of the
man’s on the outside.”</p>

<p>A voice said: “<i>You are accusing my son
wrongfully, and you must suffer for it.</i>”</p>

<p>“My God! Did you hear that?”</p>

<p>“Did I hear that? Yes, and I have heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that and more so many times that I have become
quite familiar with the voice and do not
feel alarmed at hearing it. Tell me what it
was—<em>you!</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>You, you</em>, tell me what you think it was,
and I will tell you something, then.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I am not going to try to express
myself, for I can not do so, but I will go back
to my part of the work.”</p>

<p>“You will remain here with me and express
yourself as to what your belief is in regard to the
mysterious voice we hear.”</p>

<p>“Come, quick!”</p>

<p>It was Pat’s voice.</p>

<p>“Come quick! The fellow is talking himself
to death. I have bate him for half an hour
and he is still talking, and devil a bit does he
care for my bating.”</p>

<p>“I will leave you and go with Pat.”</p>

<p>“You will have to do something quick. He
has disturbed the whole prison and the bating
I gave him helped to excite the other prisoners’
curiosity to know what the man was being
baten for.”</p>

<p>“Right this way, I think, is the nearest, Pat.
Avoid excitement as much as possible.”</p>

<p>“You will see the poor devil throwing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
hands and telling that he is not the murderer.
And he is mumbling something about not going
to be punished for a crime he never committed.”</p>

<p>“You in trouble again? Not satisfied without
disturbing the prisoners as well as the
officials?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir, I have been doing
all I could do, and working, sir, since you placed
me here. I felt a dizziness come over me. I
don’t know how long I stood before I regained
myself.”</p>

<p>“Do you feel as if you had had a good
beating?”</p>

<p>“I? No, sir, I do not.”</p>

<p>“Then the devil take the man I will ever
punish again,” said Pat; “I’ve been working
myself out of breath bating him and then he
stands up there and tells that he didn’t know
he got a bating.”</p>

<p>“You feel as if you could do the work, do
you?”</p>

<p>“I will try, sir. It is awful hard and I feel
I haven’t strength to last the day through, but
I will go as long as I can.”</p>

<p>“Now, Pat, we will return to the office, and
I want you to tell Mr. Pearson the trouble you
had with this fellow, and while you are telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
him, and telling how quietly he was working,
you as well as I will watch Mr. Pearson’s face
and see how much sympathy, if any, goes out
to the prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Indade, your honor, I have noticed the
sympathy shown to the prisoner by Mr. Pearson,
while you were away. He even offered to exchange
coat and hat with the man, and job too.”</p>

<p>“Pat, are you telling me the truth? A man
holding the position which Mr. Pearson does,
making such sacrifices as that with a prisoner,
and one who is here sentenced for the crime
which he is? Now, before we go in, I caution
you to be watchful.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Pearson, a time we have had
with the 78 convict, a murderer, and the worst
hypocrite I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“You found things as Pat represented them,
did you?”</p>

<p>“No, I did not. The fellow was working
very hard when we reached the place.”</p>

<p>“The same thing occurred with me. I once
hastened to investigate and found him as you
did, doing his duty. So, sometimes, we are not
to judge the poor prisoner too harshly, for we
are not always informed correctly.”</p>

<p>“I am here to speak for myself. I am the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
one who has informed you, as well you know,
and I will prove to you, your honor,” said Pat,
“that I gave the man a good bating.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that would not be hard for me to believe.
You did that, but it would be hard to
make me believe some of the reports that have
been made against the prisoner.”</p>

<p>“You seem to take a deep interest in No.
78. What is the secret, pray tell me?”</p>

<p>“I have no secret, sir.”</p>

<p>“<i>I have a secret which I shall tell some day,
and you will believe me</i>,” a voice was heard to say.</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">Pat Allows the Prisoner to Escape.</span></h2>

<p>“I am going to leave you in charge of this
place and I am going to investigate. I shall
don a suit of one of the guards and follow this
man around from morning until night and see
if I will have any trouble with him.</p>

<p>“Come along, Pat. Find me a club. That
is about the first thing I shall have to do—use
it on goodness knows whom. But someone is
going to get a punishment from me.”</p>

<p>“If you find a job with the last fellow I had
to bate, you will have a good job.”</p>

<p>“Now, Pat, did you notice any strange actions
about this mutt, Mr. Pearson? I did, and
I am under the impression that some secret lies
there, and the old saying is, ‘Murder will out.’”</p>

<p>“You are not of the opinion that he is
guilty of murder?”</p>

<p>“I see, Pat, that you do not understand me.
I believe that Mr. Pearson knows this convict,
in some way that he does not care to tell. There
is a mystery there.”</p>

<p>“Now, here is a club I have carried, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
know a good one. And if you want two, here
is another.”</p>

<p>“What would I do with two, Pat? One is
all you can use at one time.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m thinking that if he had two
clubs in his hands, as he was throwing them,
I would never have been able to give him the
bating I did.”</p>

<p>“I hope that I shall not have to use one,
Pat, much less two. Now, I am going to take
charge of the prisoner, and, Pat, as I shall be
close to him all of the time, you had better
drop around to the office quite often and see
how Mr. Pearson is getting along.”</p>

<p>“I will do that, your honor.”</p>

<p>“You may go—no, I will go alone, as I will
then be less liable to be noticed.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Good luck to you and your
new job.”</p>

<p>“Now for the mystery to be solved,” said
the superintendent. “I shall follow that fellow
until I satisfy myself who is right and who is
wrong. And I shall find out if Pat is as faithful
as he has been supposed to be. I feel that the
accused man has someone to help him in all
of this work, but who the helper is, that I
should like to know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>As he approached the prisoner the superintendent
said: “I thought that I would take
care of you for a while—or, at least, try to. I
see that you are doing very nicely, and I am
glad. I hope that you will try and live up to
the rules. You may speak to me when spoken
to, but do not speak without being spoken to.”</p>

<p>“I am going to pass by and take a peep at
our new officer, and see how he likes his job,”
said Pat. “Well, be jabers, he is not here!
Where in the deuce has he gone? Say, do you
hear me? Shake this door if you do. Spake,
and if you don’t spake, spake anyway.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll have to find out if he has drew
his wages and quit his job, without giving the
firm notice. Hello! hello! Well, the only thing
I can do is to go for the other fellow. I think
he has got a key. Perhaps the next fellow that
gets the job will be me.</p>

<p>“What in the deuce do I see, away back in
the corner? As sure as I am alive, it is him.
Well, well, wake up! You have got a easy job,
I know, but I don’t think you need to lay down
and go to sleep by the side of it.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t wake the poor devil, but I
know someone who can. And I would hate to
be in the poor devil’s shoes if that one comes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and finds him slapin’. So here’s to the office
and report, as I promised to do, if I lose my
job by doing so. Someone is sure going to lose
his job here, and that very shortly.”</p>

<p>“Well, Pat, what are you doing around here?”
said the superintendent. “Why are you looking
so excited? I am getting along fine here.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am not getting along fine there.”</p>

<p>“What is wrong, Pat?”</p>

<p>“The fellow that you left in your office has
laid down and gone to sleep on the job. And
he locked the door before he did so. He was
very careful that no one could get in or out.”</p>

<p>“Gone to sleep? And the door locked?
Here, you watch this man and I will see what
is the meaning of this.”</p>

<p>“If he don’t get his nap out before the officer
gets there, it will be a pity.”</p>

<p>“Here! What is wrong, Mr. Pearson?”</p>

<p>“Wrong? Nothing is wrong.”</p>

<p>“Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“I have been here, sir, and very busy.”</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Pearson, were you not asleep
with the door locked on the inside?”</p>

<p>“I am not guilty. Pat has been giving you
some more reports—and false ones, if he has
told you that I was sleeping. I have not felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
well, in the last thirty minutes. I felt a dizziness
come over me, but I feel all right now.”</p>

<p>“Do you know if you were asleep at any time,
or in a faint, while you were feeling dizzy?”</p>

<p>“I was not, sir. I was sitting at this desk,
as you see me.”</p>

<p>“And I am being deceived by one in whom
I have placed confidence. Pat is a good fellow.
I can not believe that he would deceive me.
Perhaps, after all, I had better watch him, as
well as the other one,” thought the superintendent.
“I need help. I have too many to
watch. I can not be here and there too, but I
will stay by the prisoner until I have satisfied
myself that he is right or wrong.”</p>

<p>“Come quick! Help! help! The fellow has
turned into a woman and it looks as if there
were half a dozen people where he is,” called
Pat; “and he spakes like a woman. All he would
have to do would be to put on a woman’s clothes
and you would let him pass out on her voice, be
jabers! She might be cultivating the voice to
make her get away, but when they get by Pat
they will have to go when I am aslape, for I
am not here to let anyone get away without
their papers of freedom. You will have to come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
as the prisoners are killing time, listening to the
lady speaking.”</p>

<p>“Now, office superior,” said Mr. Pearson,
“you have so much confidence in Pat, leave
him in charge of the office, and I will go with
you to see what is wrong with the prisoner—78.”</p>

<p>“I will do that.”</p>

<p>“Pat, take care of this office until we return.
Come along, Pearson. Make haste, this way.”</p>

<p>“Well, I felt all along I would be the man
to fill this place, and some day this Irishman
will be called the ‘supperior officer’ around this
prison. I hope they will succeed in finding the
lady still talking—or the gentleman, whichever
it is.”</p>

<p>“Well, officer, do you see anything wrong?
The fellow is working.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand this, and no excitement
among the prisoners.”</p>

<p>“Well, I say the trouble is in the false reports
made by Pat.”</p>

<p>“We will go back to the office and I shall
ask Pat to explain what he meant by causing
all this excitement by false reports. Now that
we are on the way back to the office, I want to
talk to you about those mysterious voices. How
do you account for them? Well, I was in hopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
you would be able to tell me something. What
have you heard, Pearson?”</p>

<p>“I have heard more than I care to hear
again.”</p>

<p>“You are not frightened, are you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I am not praying to hear any more
of it.”</p>

<p>“I am going to say to Pat that he is not
fooling anyone any more; the next time he
comes with such stories, he will be sent back
to take care of his own trouble. What, the
office door open? What does that mean? Where
is Pat?”</p>

<p>“I think Pat has left the place. After all
his false reports, he will, or perhaps has, felt
that he will be discharged, and will go before
notice is given.”</p>

<p>“Here he comes. Well, Pat, what do you
mean? Is that the way you do when trusted
with the care of this office? Did I not say to
you that I had all confidence in you? And
now you have given me cause to doubt you in
all things.”</p>

<p>“Your honor, would you have confidence in
me at all if I would sit here and let the prisoners
all walk out? Just about two minutes ago a
lady came to the office and asked to come in.
After I opened the door, she just walked right
through the office and out of the door. I called
to her to halt, and she did not stop, and I made
a start for her, and in all my life I never saw
a female get the space between her and me as
she did.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me that you have let
some of the prisoners get away?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“I mane to tell you that the lady that came
through that door got away—prisoner, or whatever
you may call her.”</p>

<p>“Pat, I am not going to discharge you now,
for I shall have to see what convict it was and
what was her sentence here. Then I shall be
better able to deal with you. I am sorry, Pat,
that you have proved to be such an untrustworthy
guard, and I, as well as Mr. Pearson,
here, have found you to be misrepresenting
things all along and causing any amount of
trouble. Now you may go and do what the
last orders gave you to do, and I will take care
of my man. If you find any more strange
things around here, don’t come to me. I shall
not go to investigate another call from you.
Now go.”</p>

<p>“Your honor, I would like to spake a word
in my own behalf. I am not as you have expressed
yourself that I was, untrustworthy. I
will swear to my Father in Heaven that I have
been honest, honest in all my actions, and when
I called for help, you were informed right. I
gave the correct reports, and I want to say now
that if you have that kind of opinion of me, I
will lave the prisoners and you may look for
another Pat. I am not a thafe. If so, I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
be wearing the stripes instead of the blue, and
I feel I have been misjudged. I hope that you
will find out that Pat was just what you thought,
true and trustworthy, and I will say to you
that you had better keep an eye on your fellow-officer,
Mr. Pearson. I feel that he has caused
you to form the opinion you have.”</p>

<p>“Pat, go and do your duty, and all will
work out right by and by.”</p>

<p>“I will, your honor; but whenever you want
the club I carry, the same is yours for the asking.
I am ready to quit when I am not the
gentleman I should be.”</p>

<p>“Pearson, have you ever had any trouble
with Pat?”</p>

<p>“I have not.”</p>

<p>“I believe that you and he have not the
best of feeling for each other. Can you explain
the condition?”</p>

<p>“I have no grievance against Pat. I do
not understand why he should bring in such
alarming reports, reports which on investigation
prove to be untrue, absolutely untrue, with
no base or foundation whatever, and that is why
I am not particularly fond of Pat.”</p>

<p>“It is all a very strange affair. During my
absence did you have a conversation with Convict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
78? And what was the object of that conversation?
What was your reason for dismissing
Pat, after he had brought the convict in?”</p>

<p>“I do not remember doing so.”</p>

<p>“I have been informed that you did. There
should be no secrets among the officials and
the prisoners.”</p>

<p>“<i>I am going to explain. I am the mother of
these two boys, and the Prisoner 78 and my son
Pearson, here, are brothers. Pearson knows that
his brother is an innocent man, but is ashamed to
acknowledge his brother. But the prisoner is as
innocent as you, who are trying to punish him for
a crime he never committed.</i>”</p>

<p>“Do you hear that voice, Pearson?”</p>

<p>“I do, but from whom does it come? There
is no one here that I can see.”</p>

<p>“<i>You will see me</i>,” the voice was heard to say.</p>

<p>“‘I will see you.’ Did I hear that? Did
you get that, officer?”</p>

<p>“I did, and I heard more; I heard the same
voice say that you and this man, Convict 78,
were brothers. Did you hear that?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Well—”</p>

<p>“I am not sure of it. I only know that he
carries my name, and his Christian name is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
same as that of a brother of mine whom I have
not heard from in years. He ran away from
home when a small boy, and we never heard
from him afterward. We thought he was dead,
as he never returned or wrote. Poor mother
grieved herself to her grave for that lost, wayward
son. I remained home with her until
she died.”</p>

<p>“And the estate—did you advertise for him?”</p>

<p>“My father died when I was a small boy
and left mother in good circumstances. I and
this brother who left home were the only heirs.”</p>

<p>“And you got the bulk of the estate? Did
I understand you to say that you advertised
for your brother?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, it was this way: not hearing
from him for so many years, I decided that
he was dead, and I did not think it worth
while.”</p>

<p>“You are not sure that this is not your
brother, then, Mr. Pearson?”</p>

<p>“No, I am not sure.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will send for him and we perhaps
may be able to find out by questioning him.
Ring for Pat.”</p>

<p>Just then Pat, mumbling, “I will stroll
around and see if the supperior officer has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
changed his mind about me being a gentleman,”
appeared.</p>

<p>“Here is Pat, now.”</p>

<p>“Pat, bring in No. 78, at once.”</p>

<p>“Whenever the man says ‘Pat,’ I know that
78 is wanted. Well, if that don’t bate annything!
I wonder now what he has done? I
know that he has been good the last half-hour,
for I have been watching him with my own
very eyes, and devil take the one that has lied
on him, now. Look at the poor fellow! He
has the same feeling that I have. Every time
he sees me coming he knows that he is wanted.</p>

<p>“Well, you are wanted at the office, and come
along quick, and have it over with. I feel very
queer—I feel like I have ate a fly for my breakfast.
Only a different feeling comes on a fellow
so quick when something is going to happen,
and you don’t know what it is.</p>

<p>“Your honor, do you want him now? If so,
here he is.”</p>

<p>“If I did not want him, Pat, I should not
have sent for him. You may be seated over
there.”</p>

<p>“You see, the convict is sometimes treated
with poor courtesy. Then I—I have not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
asked to have a chair,” Pat was mumbling to
himself.</p>

<p>The officer turned to the prisoner:</p>

<p>“You are enrolled here in the name by
which you were christened, are you not?”</p>

<p>“I am, sir.”</p>

<p>“Clarence Pearson, is that your real name?”</p>

<p>“It is, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember anything about your
people?”</p>

<p>“I do, sir.”</p>

<p>“Tell me all you know about your family,
and the number of children, brothers and sisters,
and if your parents are living, and where
you were born.”</p>

<p>“I was a small boy when I left home, many
years ago. My father I don’t remember much
about. My poor dear mother has often told me
that I was quite young at the time of his death.
I have no sisters. I have one brother, who was
at home when I left. I have since heard that
my dear mother has died. After I heard that,
I never had the heart nor courage to go home
again.”</p>

<p>“Was your mother in comfortable circumstances?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir! My mother was a wealthy
woman.”</p>

<p>“And you will swear that that is your name?”</p>

<p>“I will, sir.”</p>

<p>“Pat, you may take him back.”</p>

<p>“<i>You will not close the iron doors behind my
child again! He is far more a free man, or should
be, than the one sitting there in silence.</i>”</p>

<p>“Well, Pat, why don’t you take him? He
is ready.”</p>

<p>“So am I, but when you tell me to do a
thing, and then tell me not to, how in the name
of common sense do I know what to do?”</p>

<p>“I have given you only one instruction, and
that was to go.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, who the devil told me not to
take him?”</p>

<p>“Did you get such orders?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Just now, and I got more than that.”</p>

<p>“What did you get?”</p>

<p>“I heard a voice—where it came from I
don’t see, but my hearing is good—and this is
what it said—I will look about me and see that
I am not knocked down after I tell what I
heard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go on, and tell what you heard.”</p>

<p>“Faith, and I will tell every word of it. I
heard—as you finished telling me to take him
back—I heard a voice say: ‘The doors will not
close behind—’”</p>

<p>“I can’t think what is the matter, Pat.”</p>

<p>“I am getting them. I will be a dead man,
here, soon, like some of the other ones around
here has been. Anyway, I didn’t take the man
back, did I?”</p>

<p>“Pat, you are acting funny. What is the
matter with you?”</p>

<p>“Come along here! I will lock <em>you</em> up if
you are the guilty one.”</p>

<p>“Pat, you are not going to take Mr. Pearson.
He has not committed a crime.”</p>

<p>“I say, come along here! You are the thief,
to rob your brother of all and then sit and let
him suffer.”</p>

<p>“You are going mad, Pat. I shall have to
call for help if you do not turn Officer Pearson
loose.”</p>

<p>“Call for help. All the power you have in
this prison could not conquer me.”</p>

<p>“I shall turn in a general alarm if you do
not let him go.”</p>

<p>“<i>Turn in your alarm. I am ready to fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
for my innocent son’s freedom, and you too know
that he is not a murderer, yet you sit there and
allow him to suffer, and for another’s crime. Here
is the murdered woman standing here declaring
his innocence—and the real murderer is her husband,
and you have not made an effort to find
him. Go look for him. Place my innocent boy
in a closed room, if you like, but never behind
bars. I will free him, as I have done all the time
here, if you dare to place him behind bars again!</i>”</p>

<p>“You will fall, Pat. Sit down. Here, steady,
now. Give me some water quick. Have some
water, Pat. He looks so queer. Oh! you feel
all right, Pat?”</p>

<p>“I am not ailing. Why do you ask me if
I feel all right? The only thing I see, I was
standing up a while ago, and now I am sitting
down.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Pat; you were acting very funny, and
insisted on taking Officer Pearson to jail, instead
of No. 78.”</p>

<p>“Faith, I think he will be there soon enough.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you. I am going to
make you suffer for that talk. I shall not allow
myself to be called a thief by my inferiors.
I shall have a settlement with you, sir. Either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
you or I will leave here, and I think that you
will be the one to go.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of that. You may be
wearing stripes around here yourself, and I, the
common Irishman, telling you what to do and
throwing the bread and water at you.”</p>

<p>“Hey, Pat! What do you mean? Why are
you doing all this talking? Are you accountable
for what you are saying? I shall have to stop
this talk at once. We are not in the habit of
allowing our employees to talk in that manner.”</p>

<p>“I think that Pat has served his time here.
He is beginning to think that he is the boss.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d like to say the same thing about
you in regard to serving time, but I don’t think
you have started in on your time yet, and when
your brother who is sitting here tells all he
knows, you will be wearing his clothes and he
will be wearing something better, for some of
that money belonging to him which you have
will enable him to do unto you as you should
do unto him—and that is, help when in trouble.”</p>

<p>“Pat, I am speaking to you for the last
time, and I shall have to discharge you if you
do not quiet yourself.”</p>

<p>“<i>You will not discharge him.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, did you decide what to do? Shall
I take 78 back?”</p>

<p>“Pat, you talk and look and act quite differently
now. What was wrong? Do tell.”</p>

<p>“I am just the same Irishman. Do you
think I have changed in looks? I hope not,
for who ever saw a homely Irishman?”</p>

<p>“You did change in looks, but look all right
now. Put the prisoner in the other office—No.
2. I may need him soon. Then you may
go.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Pearson, what does all this mean?
I don’t understand. But I shall not cease the
investigation until I find out what is wrong.”</p>

<p>“You are paying too much attention to
what Pat has been saying.”</p>

<p>“I am not referring to Pat’s sayings. I am
asking you, or will do so, to explain about this
man bearing the same name and having the
same birth-place and the same number in his
family as you have told me that you have.
Your statements were identical, and do you not
know that this is your brother? I believe that
he is, and why do you not want to acknowledge
him, or find out whether he is guilty or
innocent?”</p>

<p>“How often, sir, do we meet men who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the same name as ourselves—many time the
surname and the Christian name are the same.
I am under the impression that this is one of
those times.”</p>

<p>“And I am very sorry, Pearson, but I am
thinking that, although it is very unfortunate
for you, this is not an accident.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I will make it plainer. I think
that the convict here is your brother, and you
know it.”</p>

<p>“You are judging me too harshly. I am
not deserving of that opinion from you.”</p>

<p>“You must do something to prove your innocence;
otherwise I shall notify the authorities
and lay the circumstances before them.”</p>

<p>Pearson was silent.</p>

<p>“You have my sympathy, but we should
show no partiality in our dealings with our
fellow-men. They must be treated fairly. Even
prisoners must receive justice. I shall leave you
to think this matter over, and you may report
to me, later, how you feel about the matter.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to think over and decide
on.”</p>

<p>“Then you will acknowledge that you are
his brother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“I may be, and if I am, I shall only be by
birth. I shall never claim a murderer for a
brother.”</p>

<p>“<i>You are accusing him wrongfully. He is
not a murderer.</i>”</p>

<p>“Pearson, for God’s sake, where did that
voice come from?”</p>

<p>“I can not tell.”</p>

<p>“<i>Then I will show myself.</i>”</p>

<p>“Mother, mother, mother! Help! help!”</p>

<p>“Well, I have stayed away long enough. I
think it’s about time they was doing something
to the poor convict.” It was Pat’s voice, this
time. “Perhaps I will be needed. I hear a
call for help. I may find the whole bunch
dead.”</p>

<p>“Come quick, Pat!”</p>

<p>“What in the ⸺ is the matter, now?”</p>

<p>“I was talking to Pearson, and he threw
up his hands and cried out, ‘Mother!’ three
times, and called for help. He has fainted.
You had better call a doctor, or go for one;
the wires may be busy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think the wires is crossed at this
end, and I am belaving someone will lose his
job before they get them straightened, and if
it is me, I am willing to go. Many a poor devil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
would be glad to lose his job here. I hope I
find the doctor in and not busy. The poor
officer may get tired laying in a fit so long.”</p>

<p>“Well, Pat, you have got another dead man
for me to take care of, have you?”</p>

<p>“That is what I came for, and you had
better make it lively. The superior officer don’t
feel very comfortable over the affair.”</p>

<p>“You mean that I am wanted at the office?”</p>

<p>“And I would not be saying so if you were
not wanted.”</p>

<p>“Well, Pat, I sometimes think that you are
like the Dutchman. I must take you as you
mean, and not as you say.”</p>

<p>“You had better get a move on you, for I
mane it.”</p>

<p>“You are walking so fast I can not keep up.”</p>

<p>“Indade, he told me to go for you because
I go faster than the wires, and I want to keep
up my reputation with the boss.”</p>

<p>“You are trying to make a record for yourself,
are you?”</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">Another Dead Man.</span></h2>

<p>As the two entered the office the superintendent
exclaimed: “You are slow about getting
here. I believe Mr. Pearson is dead.”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” replied the doctor; “but I
will see in a moment.” Then: “Pulsation very
weak. Did he complain of feeling ill before he
collapsed?”</p>

<p>“No, doctor; only some excitement and—”</p>

<p>“He seems to have been affected very deeply
from it. I am alarmed.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that we should send for more
help?”</p>

<p>“I am not of the opinion that they could
do any more than I am doing.”</p>

<p>“You are going to need the stretcher.”</p>

<p>“To the 78 cell, doctor! And a stretcher
to carry out the dead live ones!”</p>

<p>“Pat, step inside and see what is the matter
with No. 78. I hear a noise.”</p>

<p>“I am going to have the club ready. I am
not feeling very good, and I don’t think it would
take much to get me—bated.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, doctor, I have a secret to tell you.
I have been mistrusting a convict’s relationship
to an employee of this office, and I have asked
him for a complete explanation of the affair.
I understand that he has shown some favors
to the convict in my absence. And I can not,
for the life of me, explain what the voices are
that we hear in this office, at times, pertaining
to this officer. He and I were here talking the
matter over, and I asked him if he did not
know this man was his brother. He said that
he did not. At that moment we heard a voice,
‘<i>I will show you!</i>’ and a terrible scream came
from him, and as he looked up he called his
mother three times for help, and fell as you see
him.”</p>

<p>“I have witnessed many fainting spells, but
never did I find the pulse in such a condition.”</p>

<p>“Officer,” came the voice of Pat, “I am
having a picnic, hearing the prisoner talk in
his sleep, and with his eyes open. Would you
mind coming in and getting some of the news?”</p>

<p>“You may go,” said the doctor; “I will take
care of the patient. There is nothing that you
can do.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I will see what is wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Pat, you seem to be having a free
entertainment.”</p>

<p>“You will have to name it. I call it a treat
to see a fellow talk asleep and standing, with
his eyes open all the time he is sleeping.”</p>

<p>“What is he talking about?”</p>

<p>“Listen, for yourself. He is going on so
fast I can’t run and keep up.”</p>

<p>“<i>I am telling you I am innocent. I did not
murder, and I am not guilty, and my brother who
was in a faint is all right now, and I am the spirit
of the mother of those two boys—my sons, and I
have been the mysterious one whose voice you have
heard here trying to tell you and help my son out
of this trouble. I have to explain this by inspiring
my son, as I am doing now, and I can do so,
as you see. And I have brought the woman who
was murdered with me, and she is here to say
that she was strangled to death by her husband,
not by my son. My son is not guilty of that
crime, and I want you to take this name and address
which she will give me, and send for the
real murderer. His name is Robert Devenart, and
Mrs. Devenart is here to tell you all about the
crime, and I will repeat the words after her</i>:</p>

<p>“‘<i>I was strangled to death, not by this man
here, but by my husband. I will tell all. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
having trouble with him and as he threatened me
I screamed, and the door opened, and this man,
whom I knew slightly, entered and asked if he
could be of any assistance. I tried to be brave,
and told him that I did not need any assistance.
He left, with an apology for intruding. Then my
husband clutched me by the throat and choked me
to death. Turn this man out and bring the real
murderer in. Your officer is all right. I will
go now.</i>’”</p>

<p>“Very well, doctor.”</p>

<p>“Do you feel all right, Pearson?”</p>

<p>“I am all right. I’ll just step out for some
fresh air.”</p>

<p>“I am not satisfied to think that he was in
a faint, officer. I have never come in contact
with anything like it in my whole experience
as a physician. You had hardly left the room
until he opened his eyes and looked around.”</p>

<p>“Had it not been for the fact that I might
have missed some of the words that were being
spoken, I should have called you, doctor. I
stepped into the room, and there he—the prisoner,
I mean—was standing, talking, his eyes
open and apparently he was himself. I inquired
of Pat what was wrong, and he—the
prisoner—answered by saying, ‘I am not guilty.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
The murderer’s name was given, and many
more things were said, which I dare not mention
now.”</p>

<p>“Here is Pat.”</p>

<p>“Well, give me my time. I am a brave
Irishman, I can bate a fellow to death if need
be, but I am not brave enough, when the dead
come around and talk to me, to stick around
any longer. Faith, I did not see anything, but
I surely heard, and I know that I will fall dead
if I ever see one of the dead ones walking
around here.”</p>

<p>“Pat, I can not give you your time. You
are needed here. Go along and do your duty,
and I will send for you if you are wanted.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will never send for me if the
dead want me.”</p>

<p>“Pat is a good, trusty fellow, and, doctor,
I am glad I can make a confidant of you in this
matter. I am given the address of a person.
I am going to write at once to the proper authorities
and see if they can find the name, a
very strange name. I never heard it before.
I don’t think they can get the wrong fellow if
they find one by that name.”</p>

<p>“I would advise you to investigate, officer.
People are oftentimes innocent, although apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
proved guilty by law, and I am prejudiced
against circumstantial evidence. Many
poor men are serving time because of that kind
of evidence.”</p>

<p>“<i>I am going to thank you</i>—”</p>

<p>“Did you speak? Did you?”</p>

<p>“No, doctor. You have heard some of that
voice which we hear so often. Can you explain?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; and I do not intend to stay in
here to hear any more of it, or to try to explain
it. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, doctor.”</p>

<p>“I am going to ask you to allow me a vacation,
officer. I am not feeling very well.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pearson, I have some very important
work to do in the next few days, and I shall
need you badly.”</p>

<p>“I should like to leave by the first of the
week, if possible.”</p>

<p>“It is more than likely that you can do so.
You have nothing more to say in regard to the
affair of which we were talking?”</p>

<p>“I have not. I do not feel that this man
is any relation to me, therefore I am not going
to bother anything about him.”</p>

<p>“What was your birth-place, Pearson?”</p>

<p>“I have secrets of my own. I don’t think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
that you or anyone should ask about them,
and I refuse to tell you. I am not being tried
for any crime. I do not have to answer your
questions.”</p>

<p>“Very well. You may go back to your old
position. I shall look after the office. Say,
Pearson! Here! You may take along the prisoner
here. I don’t care to have him in this
room, keeping me alert at every noise.”</p>

<p>To the prisoner Pearson said: “Come. I
will put you in your cell.”</p>

<p>“I am willing to go—to do anything that
you request me to do.”</p>

<p>“Clarence—did I understand you to say
that was your name?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Here is your cell. Step in. I will also go
in. I want to talk to you. Clarence, do you
remember anything about your old home, and
your brothers and sisters, and your father and
mother?”</p>

<p>“I have no father—he died when I was a
small boy, and sisters I have none. I have one
brother.”</p>

<p>“What was your father’s name? Of course,
I know it was Pearson, but what was his Christian
name—or have you forgotten it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have not forgotten anything about my
home. I remember all very well. It seems only
yesterday, I have such a vivid recollection of all.
My brother’s name was William O. Pearson.”</p>

<p>“What was the <i>O.</i> for?”</p>

<p>“For Oliver, and I often called him by that
name. You have such a strange way of looking
at me, officer. Do you not believe me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Clarence, I believe you. I am going
to tell you why I look at you so strangely. You
are my brother, and I am going to make this
right with you, if you will change your story
and say that you changed your name when you
got into this trouble—or, rather, that you have
gone under an assumed name since you committed
this crime. If you will do as I say, at
the end of your term, I will give you five thousand
dollars—when you walk out of this place
a free man.”</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">An Attempt to Bribe the Prisoner.</span></h2>

<p>“I have been a wanderer, and have eaten
many a back-door hand-out, but I have never
stolen nor murdered. I did not commit this
crime. You, my brother, are free, and have
money to bribe me with, and yet you do not
care enough for your own flesh and blood to look
up the real murderer. I do not want your money.
I have two strong arms, and can work, as I
have always done.”</p>

<p>“Then you would work all your life, a poor
man, rather than accept a little bribe, would
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, under the circumstances, I would. I
feel that in the end I will be better prepared to
meet my dear mother, when called home, than
you will be. Did I not have something coming
to me from the estate? My mother was a
wealthy woman when I left home.”</p>

<p>“Well, we had many reverses in business affairs,
and she died practically a poor woman.”</p>

<p>“I may be spared to live my sentence here
if I am not found innocent and discharged, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
then I shall return to the old home and investigate
affairs and see if I am not entitled to a
share in my dear mother’s estate.”</p>

<p>“Why can you not believe me? I have explained.
She died practically a poor woman.”</p>

<p>“You are not a poor man, are you, brother?”</p>

<p>“Well, I have a comfortable home.”</p>

<p>“Is that all you have?”</p>

<p>“I do not feel disposed to explain everything
to you.”</p>

<p>“Where were you to get the five thousand
dollars to bribe me with? Have you got that
much money besides your comfortable home?”</p>

<p>“I shall have ten years to get that.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you are buying me to commit a crime
and have no money to give me after I have done
so?”</p>

<p>“As I have stated, you are here for ten
years. At the time of the expiration of your term
I would in all probability have that amount.”</p>

<p>“May I ask you why you wish me to deny
my name?”</p>

<p>“Well, Clarence, I am holding a good position
here, and I could not, perhaps, if it were
known that I had a brother inside of these
walls. Besides, I have a family in society, and
it would injure them if this should all come out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are thinking of yourself and your family
and society, and not once have you given
your poor brother a thought of sympathy. And
he is innocent of crime.”</p>

<p>“I am trying to help you. Have I not offered
you five thousand dollars at the end of
your term?”</p>

<p>“You are not helping me. No, sir. I have
registered under my own name, given me by my
dear parents, and I have no cause to disown it.
I did nothing to disgrace it, and I am not going
to be tempted with your money.”</p>

<p>“I am sure that you will regret this, Clarence.
I would favor you in many ways while
you were serving your sentence.”</p>

<p>“Could you not do so, as you are one of
the officials, without my doing as you wish me
to do?”</p>

<p>“Well, no. I should be suspected.”</p>

<p>“Then how could you do so if I did as you
request me to do—disown my name?”</p>

<p>“Well, well!”</p>

<p>“You are doing wrong, Oliver, to try to get
me in deeper instead of helping me out. Why
don’t you go out and look up the real murderer
and prove your brother innocent? I am quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
sure I should not disgrace you if it were proved
that I had been sent here an innocent man.”</p>

<p>“You see, after one has been behind prison
bars, he is always looked down upon by the
public.”</p>

<p>“But not in the eyes of God. He knows the
guilty from the innocent.”</p>

<p>“Then you feel that you would rather stay
in prison and work ten years, and go out a broken
man and penniless, than to receive five thousand
dollars, as I have promised you?”</p>

<p>“If I have to lie for it, I’ll take the poverty
and peace of mind.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for you, Clarence, and I shall
return and have another talk with you some
day. Perhaps you will change your mind.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, brother, for the word spoken
just now. Yes, my brother, you have a comfortable
home and a family in society, and an
innocent brother in prison for ten years.”</p>

<p>“You have the habit of talking to yourself,
have you?” It was Pat who spoke.</p>

<p>“It helps a fellow, Pat, sometimes, when
alone, to talk to himself.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I heard two voices in here. I
was after looking for a convict who occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the next cell, 79, and I felt rather uneasy about
you, and I thought I would see what you were
doing, and I heard a very strange conversation
in here.”</p>

<p>“Pat, did you hear all that was said?”</p>

<p>“Sure I did. What was I listening for if not
to hear what was said?”</p>

<p>“And did you see anyone leave here?”</p>

<p>“Sure I did. When I see a man passing this
way, I looked to find if he was a broke-away.”</p>

<p>“And will you—”</p>

<p>“I will keep my mouth shut until I have to
open it.”</p>

<p>“And would you tell all you heard?”</p>

<p>“Indade I would. Well, I think I will be
going along. I will stroll by the office and see
if he looks any the better off since he could not
get rid of his five thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Pat, you always come just in time. Take
this letter to the office. I want it to go out on
the first mail. If I wait for it to be taken up,
it would not get off on the first mail. Make
haste, as I am quite anxious for this to go.”</p>

<p>“You can depend on it going if I have to
take the train and carry it myself.”</p>

<p>To himself: “Well, I wonder what the rush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
was. I will pick up the torn pieces when I get
the chance, and see what this means.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pearson,” said the superintendent, “I
am called to attend to some business affairs.
I shall leave you in charge of the office. I may
not return until late.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, I just made the train. The next
time I would like a few minutes to think between
this place and the train. I never went
so fast in all my life. I would be a good messenger.
I could get the bad news to them in
a hurry, as all of the confounded things have
bad news in them.</p>

<p>“There comes Pat. I will give him the order
I left with Pearson.</p>

<p>“Pat, I am going on some business, and I
want you to put all of those torn pieces of paper
in the fire and burn them up. I do not want
anyone to see them. I made some errors and
re-wrote the letter,” said the superintendent.</p>

<p>“Now you have gone,” said Pearson, “I will
take care of those torn pieces of paper. Here
is an envelope addressed to the place where
Clarence committed the murder, and here is
all of the letter. Now I’ll see what was the
cause for rush.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter ran as follows:</p>

<p>“I am writing you for help in looking up
the case of a convict by the name of Clarence
Pearson. I have every reason to believe that
he is innocent of the crime for which he is serving
sentence. Wire me if you have a name in
the directory of your city like this: Devenart.
If there is such a man, hold him for murder.”</p>

<p>“My God!” gasped Pearson. “What does
this mean? I am lost. I feel that they will
find him innocent, and I guilty of crime; and
I have sworn to the death of Clarence, so
that I might receive his share of the estate.
Now it is all to come out.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Pat, “I met the officer, and
he told me to clean up around and destroy the
papers he has written on, and I don’t see any.”</p>

<p>“I had nothing to do and I put things in
order,” said Pearson.</p>

<p>“Where did you throw the scraps?”</p>

<p>“I put them in the fire.”</p>

<p>“Did you lave the office to do it?”</p>

<p>“No, I did not leave the office.”</p>

<p>“Then where is the fire you put them in?
I was told to burn them and I must obey orders.
If you did not burn them, I will be after doing
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are always meddling in someone’s affairs,
Pat. You go along. I am taking care
of this place.”</p>

<p>“And I’m thinking you are taking care of
some things in this place—at least, I would like
to see those torn pieces of paper.”</p>

<p>“You may go to No. 78’s cell and see if he
wants to come here. I would like to talk with
him. Perhaps I can get some idea of the kind
of work he could do.”</p>

<p>“I will obey you. Now it is up to the poor
convict to take his choice of work. And if he
plases to come, he can.”</p>

<p>To the prisoner: “Well, are you asleep?
Would you like to take a walk over to the office?
Now, you don’t have to go if you don’t
want to.”</p>

<p>“I am willing, Pat, to do anything I am asked
to do.”</p>

<p>“You are very obliging. I’m sure I would
be plased if all the convicts would be as agreeable
as you.”</p>

<p>“You may bring him in, Pat, and then go
to your work. I shall not need you any more
at present,” said Pearson.</p>

<p>“I’ll go, but devil a bit will I work. I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
think annyone needs me now, and I’ll just sit
down here until someone does need me.”</p>

<p>“Clarence, you have been thinking this over,
have you—what we were talking about? I
hope you will be sensible now, and make up
your mind to do as I want you to.”</p>

<p>“You want me to swear that I am not Clarence
Pearson?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You will be helping yourself by so
doing.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I will.”</p>

<p>“That will help you to look forward for
something to live on ten years from now.”</p>

<p>“Well, what can I do to help you out of
your trouble?”</p>

<p>“My trouble? I am not in trouble.”</p>

<p>“You are not worried over my not doing
as you requested me to do?”</p>

<p>“No. Only for your own good.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me, if I change my mind when
the time comes to deny it, what harm could it
do you?”</p>

<p>“I should have to—”</p>

<p>“Finish what you were going to say.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you all, Clarence, if you will promise
me that you will do as I want you to.”</p>

<p>“Well, tell me, brother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am going to make a clean breast of it all.”</p>

<p>“I think I had better be getting up closer,”
whispered Pat. “I may think I’m hearing and
not hear, for I am looking for the poor devil to
tie a noose around his neck before he gets
through with the clean breast he spoke of.”</p>

<p>“Go on, Oliver; tell me. You are talking
to your brother. You need not fear my betraying
you—never, Oliver!”</p>

<p>“You left home, Clarence, when a small
boy. You never wrote and poor mother and I
mourned you as dead. Years afterward mother
died, and, not knowing where you were, I was
called upon to swear that you were dead, and
I did so. In that way I fell heir to all of the
estate, which was numbered in the hundred
thousands. And, not knowing of your whereabouts,
I decided to invest it, and I lost it all,
except what I have told you of.”</p>

<p>“I do not see the point in your demanding
that I deny my name.”</p>

<p>“Do you not see that I have sworn falsely
to obtain the money, and you know that places
me just where you are to-day, Clarence.”</p>

<p>“Only you are guilty, Oliver, and I am not.”</p>

crammed full now, and I have got to keep it
there till I can let it out, a little at a time, and
it takes a man a long time to tell the judge and
keep from telling what he don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“I know that I am guilty, but you can save
me if you will.”</p>

<p>“Brother Oliver, I am sorry for you and I
will do all I can for you. I will do as you have
asked me to do.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, dear brother. And I shall be a
brother to you while you are in prison.”</p>

<p>“Now I think they have all the secrets told,
and I’ll walk around and see if I can persuade
the officer to tell me where the fire was. He
was so obliging to do my work for me,” mumbled
Pat.</p>

<p>“Come along, Pat; you may take the fellow
back,” called Mr. Pearson.</p>

<p>Pat to himself: “Oh! he is being called a
‘fellow,’ is he? If I bring him here to the
office many more times, he will be a gentleman,
not a convict.”</p>

<p>Aloud: “Come along here! Back to your
resting-place. Indade, that is all you have done
lately—rest.”</p>

<p>The acting superintendent mused: “Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
that Clarence is going to deny his name, I can
see my way out of this. I shall not take my
vacation now. I must stay and see this thing
through. So my superior officer has written to
where the murder was committed and asked
for a wire in answer. And we may look for
one to-morrow, as the letter went out on the
early train. It will be received in the morning,
and a wire will be received some time in the
evening.”</p>

<p>“Well, ‘fellow,’ here is your place to rest till
I come for you, and you may look for me soon,
at that,” remarked Pat as he placed the prisoner
in his cell.</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">The Convict’s Prayer.</span></h2>

<p>As the superintendent entered the office on
his return he said to Pearson: “I am back.
I have been looking up some of your history
in the past.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand you, officer.”</p>

<p>“You will, however.”</p>

<p>“Why are you looking up my reputation?”</p>

<p>“I have every cause to do so. I see that you
have the same name as the convict, or he has
the same name as you have. Of course that
is nothing unusual, for two men often have the
same family name, and even Christian name;
but you are favoring this prisoner in many ways,
which looks suspicious. I have never noticed
that you favored other prisoners, and I do not
believe that you would do so without some
secret reason, in this case.”</p>

<p>“I have only tried to treat him humanely.”</p>

<p>“I see the humane part of it, Pearson.”</p>

<p>“I think I will walk around and see how
the fellow is looking after he has spent this
five-thousand-dollar bribe and got the poor convict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to deny his own name. I wonder what he
will take for a name if he denies the one he
has got. For the love of Mike, I hope it won’t
be Pat! Indade, I don’t want to have a name
like annyone of the prisoners in here, and, thank
God! the place has no Pats. An Irishman is
too slick to come here against his own free will.”</p>

<p>Pat was approaching the office.</p>

<p>“Well, officer, you back?”</p>

<p>“I am back, Pat.</p>

<p>“You may go, Pearson. I will send for you
when I need you.”</p>

<p>“And if you knew all I know, you would
need him now, before he went.”</p>

<p>“Well, Pat, have you done anything with
Prisoner 78?”</p>

<p>“I? No, sirree; he is a ‘fellow’—a pet around
here, he is.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Pat—a ‘fellow,’ ‘pet’?”</p>

<p>“Well, your honor, I never was a tell-tale,
and I don’t want to begin now.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything, Pat, that I should
know?”</p>

<p>“I think if you knew all I do, you would
have another prisoner in here to feed.”</p>

<p>“I have always trusted you, Pat. Can not
you now trust me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure I can trust you, but what about the
other fellow. Can I trust him?”</p>

<p>“I will take care of that part of it if you
will tell me what you know, Pat.”</p>

<p>“I am going to think it over myself a while.
I don’t like to report too many times, for fear
I don’t get it the same each time.”</p>

<p>“You may not have to repeat, Pat.”</p>

<p>“I hope not, for I feel sorry for the poor
man, to think he has no feeling.”</p>

<p>“You would just as well tell all you know.
I am investigating, as it is, and I think along
those lines, and ‘murder will out,’ you know.”</p>

<p>“And some things will out themselves, as
well as murder.”</p>

<p>“Pat, in justice to yourself, you will have
to tell me what you know. Here comes Pearson.
I will hear what you have to say later.
You may go.”</p>

<p>“I am going to remain on guard to-night,
officer, and I shall not be in the office. I speak
of this so that you will not keep late hours
for me.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Pearson.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what he is up to now,” thought
the superintendent. “I must be on guard myself
to-night, and I must remain where I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
watch cell No. 78. It is now ten-thirty o’clock—a
good hour to lock up the office. I’ll walk
quietly to cell 77—it is empty to-night—and
I may know more in the morning than I do
to-night. Here comes Pat. I will tell him to
keep watch on the office to-night, for emergency
calls. He can hear the bells ringing, and if—well,
by George! I’d rather Pat would not
know where I am. I’ll have to take the chances
of the bells ringing. I may hear them if they
do. It is not a great distance to the office.”</p>

<p>“Your honor, I’m thinking of going to my
bed. I am top-heavy, and would like to lay
me down for a while. I think it would do me
good. Too much to carry around, and too good
to let it get away.”</p>

<p>“All right, Pat; you may go.”</p>

<p>To himself: “Now I shall learn something
for myself. I’d better disguise myself, for fear
of meeting Pearson. I’ll put on this slouch
hat. He would not recognize me in that; a
hat changes one’s looks sometimes so that even
close friends could not be recognized.</p>

<p>“Hark! I hear voices! I believe it is Pearson’s
voice in cell 78. I must be very quiet.
Sure enough! Now I shall find out for myself.”</p>

<p>“I will try, Clarence, to favor you in having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
you placed in a position where you can make
your get-away, and I will give you money to
go on. Would you go if that opportunity presented
itself?”</p>

<p>“Oliver, what do you mean? Are you trying
to get me here for the rest of my life? I would
not be here at all if you would do for me what
a brother should do.”</p>

<p>“I am trying to help you, Clarence, and you
won’t let me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want your help, if I have to get it in
that way. Why don’t you do unto me as you
would have me do to you?”</p>

<p>“I have a family and they are in society, and
I am not so free to go as you are, and if this
comes out, I may have to remain here, but
not by choice.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you see the trouble I’m in?”</p>

<p>“I can see if you would get out of here and
they could not find you, then they would drop
it all, and you would be a free man and so
would I.”</p>

<p>“If I were to do as you want me to, where
could I go and what could I do? I have no
money.”</p>

<p>“Did I not say that I would help you? You
can leave the city and I will send you money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
under an assumed name. I can take care of
you.”</p>

<p>“You are looking out for yourself, I know,
Oliver. If you had not stolen all my part of
the estate, you would not be here this hour of
the night, talking to me. You have no brotherly
love for me, or you would get me out and prove
to the world that I am innocent, and take me to
your comfortable home as a long-lost brother.
I would not disgrace your society family. My
mother was a good woman, and if I did fail to
get the education I should have received, I have
a good, pure heart in me, and am one that has
always tried to do right and will do so as long
as I live. It is not always the one, Oliver, who
had the advantages, who has the best education,
that is the purest. I am at fault for not having
an education, I know, for I ran away from home
when I was a boy, but I have never committed
a crime, as you have done.”</p>

<p>“You are not looking at this as you should.
I am going to say to you that if you fail to do
as you promised me you would—if you do not
deny your name—I will murder you.”</p>

<p>“Then you would murder me for wealth and
society, would you, Oliver?”</p>

<p>“I would.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then what would you do? You could not
enjoy either.”</p>

<p>“I might say you were disobedient and that
I had to kill you. You know how much trouble
you have caused since you were here, and it
would be no trouble for me to get out of it.
So this is your warning. Now remember, I am
leaving you for the last time, to think this over,
and I want your answer to-day. It will soon
be daylight. I must not be seen in your cell.
Think this over well.”</p>

<p>“And so my brother threatens to kill me if
I do not commit a crime! And I must think
this over and let him know to-day! Well, I
could let him know now. I will not leave these
prison walls without the proper orders, and I
am afraid to say as much to him,” said the
prisoner aloud. “What shall I do? To tell
what he has done would mean a term for him
in this very prison, and not to tell means death
to me. Oh! what shall I do? Pray? Yes,
pray that dear mother will come to me and
help me; that she will not allow her honored
son to murder her dishonored son, as he threatened
to do. He said that mother mourned me
as dead. Oh, if I had only died before all this
happened! I am going to pray for help from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
now—not for material help; I do not want any
money or sympathy in poverty, I only want
help from Heaven to know what to do. I shall
kneel on this cold, hard floor and pray.</p>

<p>“Father above, I am not a murderer, as Thou
knowest. I ask forgiveness for the sins that I
have committed, for we all sin, though often unintentionally.
O Father in Heaven, I ask that
the spirit of my dear mother may be allowed to
return to earth and watch over me, that her
son Cain may not slay Abel. And, O dear Father,
I am here for another’s crime, as Thou,
blessed Father, knowest. I pray that I may be
helped—not to be freed from here until it is
proved to the world that I am innocent. I feel
my dear mother’s presence near me. Oh, how
grateful I am! Now, dear Father, give me help
to show the one who has given me so short a
time to pray the right way. The time is near
when I must decide between life and death.
Thou knowest best. I trust Thee to look after
me in this hour of need. And, O dear Father,
help my brother, that he may know and do the
right. Forgive him, Father, and lead him. Go
with each of us in our humble way. May we
ever feel Thy presence near us. May holy angels
hover around us and help and comfort us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
this time of need. May we feel their presence.
I ask this from a heart filled with faith, hope,
and love. Amen.”</p>

<p>The trembling voice was silent. The heart
of the superior officer went out in sympathy to
the poor, abused convict who had the strength
to resist temptation, and who could yet forgive
his selfish, wicked brother.</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">“Thank God, He Is Innocent!”</span></h2>

<p>“Well, I have been repaid for this night’s
work. I must get back to the office, before
I am seen coming from this cell,” said the
official.</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, Pearson. You are looking
tired. Have you had a hard night of it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I am trying to unravel a mystery,
and I am somewhat worried.”</p>

<p>“So am I, Pearson. I am trying to look
into the past life of this prisoner, No. 78. I
want to see if he has been a bad fellow. I
am under the impression that he is not guilty
of the crime for which he is being punished; he
seems so honest about his past, and he has even
given his real name, and that is some proof that
he is no crook, or murderer. He would surely
deny his name if he were either, and I feel it
my duty to look into this whole affair.”</p>

<p>“Well, officer, I am under the impression that
he has registered under an assumed name—that
he is holding back his real name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why have you formed such an impression?”</p>

<p>“Well, I have a feeling that he will tell his
real name if pressed to do so.”</p>

<p>“I will send for him and we can press him
for the truth.”</p>

<p>Pat’s voice was heard as he approached, saying:
“I wonder what this day will bring forth.
Here I am, walking to the office. I have a feeling
that it is time the ‘pet-fellow’ had a little
exercise, and I must be there in case I’m
needed.”</p>

<p>“There you are, Pat. You are always on
hand when you are needed. You may bring
No. 78 into the office.”</p>

<p>“I am getting to be a fortune-teller indade.
I can tell when I am wanted without being
told. Here, you ‘pet-fellow’! Wake up! I am
going to take you for your morning’s walk.”</p>

<p>“I am very willing to go.”</p>

<p>“I am quite sure that you will go, willing
or not. When I am told to do anything, I
usually do it. Here we are.”</p>

<p>“Bring him in, Pat.”</p>

<p>“Plase open the door. How do you expect
me to do—break in?”</p>

<p>“The night lock is thrown on, officer. How
did that happen? We never do so unless we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
all go inside of the prison. Were you in the
prison last night?”</p>

<p>“We will discuss that later. We have sent
for the prisoner and he is here. Let him in.”</p>

<p>“You may go, Pat. We have some investigations
to make, and we prefer to be alone.”</p>

<p>Pat went, out, remaining within hearing and
saying: “Here is a very comfortable seat. I
will sit meself down and I won’t have to walk
so far when I come back.”</p>

<p>“Now, did I understand you—No. 78 I am
speaking to—did I understand you to say that
you have given your real Christian name, and
surname also, to be recorded in the prison
books?”</p>

<p>“Well, I have been thinking.”</p>

<p>“About changing your name?”</p>

<p>“How do you know that, sir?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pearson has told me so.”</p>

<p>“He told you so?”</p>

<p>“Do you deny it—can you, will you?”</p>

<p>“My God! what shall I do? You have told
him all?”</p>

<p>“I have told him nothing.”</p>

<p>“Pearson, why are you so excited?”</p>

<p>“I am astonished at your falsehood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you may be more astonished before
I get through with you.</p>

<p>“Come, did I understand you to say—or
have you answered me? Do you hear me speak
to you?”</p>

<p>“I do, sir. Well, then, I will have to be
protected if I tell the truth.”</p>

<p>“From whom?”</p>

<p>“Oh, man! can not you see the danger I
am in:”</p>

<p>“You in danger? Explain in what way.
With your God, for swearing to falsehoods, or
from your fellow-man?”</p>

<p>“I have not deceived my God.”</p>

<p>“Then you have given your own real name?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you. I have.”</p>

<p>“So you want protection, now you have told
the truth? Give me the name of your enemy.”</p>

<p>“Officer, can you not relieve me of this torture?
Can you not see?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I can.</p>

<p>“Well, Pearson, do you think you could
rest comfortably behind the bars for a few
hours?”</p>

<p>“I? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that you have been trying to bribe
this man to disown his name. Now I am not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
in the dark. I understand it all, and I am
going to make a clean breast of it. I shall
send him back to his cell, and send you to
another one.”</p>

<p>“I’ll just get up and stretch myself. I may
have to use my muscles, and club too,” commented
Pat. “I hope he will like his new
home.”</p>

<p>“You must have good hearing, Pat,” said
the official. “I was just going to ring for you.
You must hear my thoughts. You may take
No. 78 back, and return at once.”</p>

<p>“I will, your honor.</p>

<p>“Walk up fast, ‘pet.’ I am going to fill
the order to a minute, and I will sure be proud
to see him leaving me alone for a while. Here
we are. Get in gently, ‘pet.’ I’ll be closing
the door aisy, to not shock you. Now I must
be bating it back to the office to get the other
man.”</p>

<p>“Well, Pearson, ‘murder will out.’”</p>

<p>“I have not murdered anyone, and why
should you talk to me in that way?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that your brother has, either.”</p>

<p>“My brother!”</p>

<p>“Yes, your brother. Do you not know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the convict is your brother? If you do not,
I do.”</p>

<p>“We have the same name. Is that any
reason why we should be brothers?”</p>

<p>“Not because you have the same name, no;
but in this case the two men who bear the same
name are brothers.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, why am I to be placed behind
the bars?”</p>

<p>“So that you may not kill your brother.”</p>

<p>“Man! I’m not going behind the bars on
any such freak ideas as yours. I shall not be
disgraced by a prisoner who has no cause to
fear me, just because he has a name like mine
and makes the statement that he fears me.”</p>

<p>“You understand it all. Pearson, here is
Pat. You may occupy cell No. 77, next to
that of your brother.</p>

<p>“Come along, Pat. Take charge of Mr.
Pearson, here.</p>

<p>“Give me your arms, officer.”</p>

<p>“I will never do so, not as long as I have
a drop of blood in my body. I shall not give
up my arms and allow Pat, the scoundrel, to
place me behind the bars.”</p>

<p>“You will have it to do, sir. I will see that
you do. Hand them over to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“I refuse to do so. I will die before I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, me friend, you had better ask your
God about that. Perhaps you are a little perverse
about going.”</p>

<p>“You are not acting wisely, Pearson. You
had just as well be brave and await the outcome.”</p>

<p>“Message here,” called out a voice.</p>

<p>“Give it to me. The charges? None? Very
well.”</p>

<p>He read: “Your answer is, ‘Yes; we have
the man in jail. Have his confession of murder
of woman.’”</p>

<p>“My God! Can it be? He has received it,
and my brother will be free.”</p>

<p>“I have not been deceived. Thank God, he
is innocent!” exclaimed the superintendent.</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">A New Prisoner in Cell 78.</span></h2>

<p>“Mr. Pearson, have you decided to go quietly?
I think you may now occupy your brother’s
cell, since he is innocent of the crime, and the
real murderer has confessed. This is the telegram
which brought the news.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps if I would call him a ‘pet’ and
‘fellow,’ he would come along with me,” said
Pat. “The officer requested me to take you,
so here, you ‘pet-fellow,’ you must go.”</p>

<p>“Pat, Pat, don’t kill him! Let him up! I
think he will go.”</p>

<p>“I think he will, too. Here, take his gun—no,
perhaps I had better take it along. I may
need two of them. I only have six cartridges,
and I have been carrying them some time. I
may get a chance now to get rid of them, and
I may need more.”</p>

<p>“Pat, get some water. I’m afraid you have
killed him.”</p>

<p>“Well, he said he would die before he would
go, and devil take him if he wanted to rush off
in a hurry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“I see his mouth twitch. I hope he will
revive soon.”</p>

<p>“I think he is saying to himself what he will
do when he gets up, but if I have anny strength
left, I think he will come along with me, as
soon as he is able to walk, and nary stretcher
will I carry him on, until I know he is indade
a dead one. He went to fight back. I think
when he comes to he will see that fighting is
hard on the eyes. See the eye turn black, will
you? You would think he had been dead a
long while and was mortifying.”</p>

<p>“Come, Pat, help me to get him on his feet.”</p>

<p>“You had better let him rest easy where
he is.”</p>

<p>“I am asking you for help, and I want it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help you, your honor. I never have
refused a thing you have asked me to do.”</p>

<p>“Come, Pearson; can you stand up? Try.”</p>

<p>“I am not hurt. I am only dizzy.”</p>

<p>“I am glad. I hope that you will now obey
orders, and not cause any more excitement.”</p>

<p>“What shall I do, officer?”</p>

<p>“Pat, show him the way.”</p>

<p>“Come along, officer—Mr. Pearson—‘pet’
‘fellow.’ Oh, how I would like to add a few
more pet names to them! Indade, when he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
no gun he is willing to ask what to do. Well,
I will show you. This way out. I feel that
you was not so very much surprised, only in the
one way.”</p>

<p>“So the poor fellow was innocent, and the
guilty one has confessed. I hope I shall never
have another innocent man here while I am in
charge of the place. I must send word to Pearson’s
family. They will be alarmed when he
does not come home. It will be a great shock
to the family—to those beautiful society daughters.
It will be a calamity to them. How shall
I break the news? I would not dare to send
Pat. He has a grievance against Pearson, and
would not show any mercy on the family. I
shall call the officials together and state the
whole circumstances, and then we can see what
steps to take to protect his family. I am anxious
to see Pat back. I hope he will not have any
more trouble. Here he comes now. Well, Pat,
is he all right?”</p>

<p>“I think he is able to talk. After he was
locked up, I stepped to one side and he thought
I had gone, and the poor brother was getting
the devil, and he promised him more than I just
now gave him. I think that the poor brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
will be scared to leave the place when he is
turned loose.”</p>

<p>“Pat, why are you referring to the brother?
What do you know about it?”</p>

<p>“I guess what I know would do someone
good and would bring someone harm.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Pat, how did you hear these
things?”</p>

<p>“I have not got these ears on the sides of
my head just for looks. They was put there
to hear with, and I am going to hear when there
are annything to be heard.”</p>

<p>“When did you hear all this, Pat?”</p>

<p>“I am after hearing it some time ago.”</p>

<p>“Pat, I thought I could trust you to tell me
everything that went wrong inside of these
prison walls.”</p>

<p>“Faith, and you can, and I would of told
you if it was wrong, your honor, but I thought
it was all right if he is guilty of staling all the
money, he ought to be punished, and I did not
think it necessary to tell you. I expected to
find out what he did with the money. Mebbe
the poor fellow could get it back.”</p>

<p>“You have a secret, Pat, and you must tell
me all about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have got to tell it some time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
if I tell it now, I will have to tell it over again,
so what is the use of telling it twice?”</p>

<p>“I believe it is something I should know
now, and perhaps I do know, but not exactly
what you do.”</p>

<p>“If I tell you now, I may not tell it the same
way the next time, and if you only hear anything
once, you will always think that is right,
and if you hear it twice and not alike, then ‘you
have not told the truth’ is the first thing you
are accused of.”</p>

<p>“Well, Pat, that is right; but can not you
remember how to tell it both times the same
way?”</p>

<p>“Yes, this ‘pen’ is holding three or four poor
devils to-day for not remembering and telling
it alike both times.”</p>

<p>“I will let you think it over, Pat. Try to
make up your mind to remember as you heard
it. You may go now, and see if Mr. Pearson
is all right. Report within the next half-hour.”</p>

<p>“Now if he is all right, do you want me to
report now, or wait the half-hour?”</p>

<p>“Pat, if anything is wrong, let me know at
once.”</p>

<p>“That I will, your honor.”</p>

<p>“Now Pat is gone, I must let the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
know, and I think I should let them know at
once, for I may not be able to get the officials
together as soon as I should like to. I will risk
it and call them over the wires, and try to explain
some minor part to them, so they will
know something is wrong. I can say that he
had some trouble with one of the prisoners, as
he has a black eye that Pat gave him. No,
that won’t do. They would ask why I was
holding him behind the bars if he had trouble.
That has often happened and the officers are
compelled to subdue the unruly prisoners, but
they do not get locked up for it. I shall have
to say something. When you try to fix up
something, you never get it said just as you
had it fixed up, so I’ll get them on the wire
and trust to saying the right thing.</p>

<p>“Central, give me Main 505, please.</p>

<p>“Hello! Is this Mrs. Pearson? Mrs. Pearson,
I have something to say to you. I should
like you to come to the office at once. No, I
hardly have time to tell you over the ’phone.
Very well. Good-bye.</p>

<p>“What did I say? I was so nervous I hardly
knew. I don’t like to tell the family about the
head of the household. I think that he could
explain better himself. I really don’t know just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
what I did say. I think I did not tell them
how bad things were. By George! I believe
that is Mrs. Pearson coming—and the beautiful
daughters too. It is. Did I tell her to come?
Yes, and here comes Pat with Pearson. My
God! has he had trouble with him again? He
is covered with blood.”</p>

<p>“Your honor, here he is. Everything was
all right when I went around, but the chap got
smart and I have been bating him for a half-hour,
then the time was up and you said report,
and here I am with what is left of him. I hear
a knock on the door.</p>

<p>“Come right in, ladies.</p>

<p>“Officer, here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, papa!”</p>

<p>“My dear husband! What has happened
to you?”</p>

<p>Pat muttered: “Only a good bating, and he
deserved it.”</p>

<p>“Pat, I must censure you for speaking in
that way. I did not intend that you should
open the door, and I intended to place him in
the second room. I had no chance to speak
to you before you opened the door. Now you
may go.”</p>

<p>“I will, your honor. You always told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
to open the door when you heard a knock.
Now you blame me for it. How do I know
what to do and do it right?”</p>

<p>Outside, Pat whispered to himself: “I have
had quite a time and feel pretty tired. I don’t
think I will go, for I have a knowledge-place
here where I get all my news, and I think I will
get some more knowledge and sit meself down
for a while. What the deuce is all of the crying
for inside? I know I did not bate him to death.”</p>

<p>“My dear madam, calm yourself. I will
explain the best I can. I hardly know how to
do so. I think Mr. Pearson could do better
than I could.”</p>

<p>“Mother, take papa home. Do, please, out
of this horrid place, never to return.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry, miss, but I—”</p>

<p>“You do not expect my husband to remain
on duty when he is suffering, do you?</p>

<p>“Tell me how did you get so badly hurt,”
said Mrs. Pearson, turning to her husband.</p>

<p>“Mother, do you not see that he can not
raise his head?”</p>

<p>Pat, listening outside, remarked: “Not because
he is hurt, little miss, but because he is
ashamed to raise his head, and I am afraid you
will not be able to raise your head up when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
this is all brought out. I feel I would of done
the poor fellow a favor if I had bate him to
death. Ho will have to die sometime, and perhaps
this would of suited him better.”</p>

<p>“He will have to remain in the hospital,
here, and we will take care of him.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I have a doctor, my family doctor,
and I want him to look after him. What did
you send for me for? Wasn’t it to take him
home?” said Mrs. Pearson.</p>

<p>“No; I did not know at the time I was
talking that he was injured. You know, he
had this trouble—I told Pat to call around to
his cell and see how he was getting along.”</p>

<p>“His cell! his cell!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my wife and dear children, I am a
prisoner here. I can not go home with you.”</p>

<p>“Papa! oh, papa!”</p>

<p>“You a prisoner here? What have you done
to be confined in this place, a prisoner?”</p>

<p>“I can not tell you. Go home. I may
never get the chance again.”</p>

<p>“You a prisoner? My husband, whom I
have promised to honor, a criminal? The father
of my children a criminal? Oh, no! I do not
believe it.”</p>

<p>“Madam, I think you had better take your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
daughters home. Calm yourself, and I will explain
all to you later.”</p>

<p>“I can not leave this place without my
husband.”</p>

<p>Pat, listening, said: “Another boarder. I
know she will object to the kind of service she
will get here, and the linen napkin. I think
she will change her mind, and I hope she will
change it now and not shed anny more tears.
I’m a hard-hearted Irishman, and could bate
a fellow to death, but when it comes to hearing
the dear ladies cry, I am finding meself dropping
a tear meself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa! tell us what you have done.”</p>

<p>“Daughter, I have deceived you all these
years, and I can do so no longer. I will tell
you now. Be brave, and listen. I was one of
the two sons my dear mother bore, and my
brother, when a small boy, ran away from home.
We never heard from him, and I thought he
was dead, as did my dear mother. Many years
afterward my poor mother died, broken-hearted
over her lost son, and I had to swear to falsehood
to obtain the estate. I swore that I knew he
was dead, and so got all of the estate. What to
do after I had received it, I did not know. I
thought to invest it would be to double the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
amount. Instead of that, I lost all except what
I had when I married your mother. Now the
lost brother is found in this prison, and I am
an embezzler. Now I must suffer for the rest
of my days.”</p>

<p>“You have carried that secret in your heart
all these years, and I, your wife, did not know
it? You deceived me, and now bring disgrace
upon your daughters?”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother! can you not see that papa is
punished enough? Do not torture him any
more,” said one of the daughters.</p>

<p>“I will disown my father if he has committed
a crime like that,” said the other one.</p>

<p>“Sister,” returned the first, “he is not at
fault. Do not speak to him in that way. You
and I are his only children, and we must not
do as those two brothers did, drift apart. We
must not make the same mistake.”</p>

<p>“Gertie, I will not allow you to compare
yourself and your sister with what could happen.
I am like daughter Amelia. I am not going
to forgive him—no, not I. I shall return to
my home and feel very uncomfortable in it,
after knowing how it was obtained. Come, my
daughters.”</p>

<p>“I shall return, papa,” said Gertie, “and see
you. I shall always love you, for you have
been a good father to me. You gave me my
education and provided instruction in music.
No one can take that away from me. I shall
always remember you and love you and I shall
do all that I can for you in times to come.
Good-bye, dear papa. Do not weep. Mother
and sister can never turn my love from you.
If I ever can redeem your good name for you,
I shall be repaid for all, and I hope and pray
that I shall be able to do so.”</p>

<p>“Gertie, you have said enough to your convict
father. Come at once. We must leave this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
horrid place, never to return. Come, come,
daughters.”</p>

<p>Addressing her husband, the wife said: “You
got in this trouble without your family’s assistance,
and you can get out the same way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother! do not talk so cruelly to papa.
I know his heart is broken. I am sure that he
believed himself right when he made the statement
that his brother was dead. He did not
dream that his brother was alive, or that he
would ever hear of him again.”</p>

<p>“Gertie, go along with your mother. I will
suffer alone.”</p>

<p>“I will share it with you, papa. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pearson, I shall place you in the second
room here, and I shall call in the officials for consultation
and see what can be done. I regret
very much to have to do so, but it is my duty.”</p>

<p>“I am a prisoner here, and shall obey your
rules. I will step inside. You may take me in.
I shall not cause you any unnecessary trouble.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have got a job, to turn the key on
the gentleman. I’ll just step in. I feel I have
saved meself a good many steps by finding meself
a resting-place so near.” It was Pat, talking
to himself.</p>

<p>“I was just turning to call for you, Pat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I am here.”</p>

<p>“You may see that water is in the room
for Pearson, then lock the door.”</p>

<p>“I will do that, your honor, with pleasure.
Where is the man to occupy the room?”</p>

<p>“He has stepped in there, Pat.”</p>

<p>“Very obliging, he is. I think that bating
did him some good.</p>

<p>“Here is some water for you, sir, and if you
want annything, call me. Or have I given you
all you wanted me to—faith, I mane in the
way of a bating?</p>

<p>“The poor fellow sits there with his head
down as though I had never said a word to him,
so I’ll lock him in and let him slape it off.”</p>

<p>“Pat, I am going to call in the high officials
to-day, and I want you to be present; I am going
to call on you for some of your knowledge.”</p>

<p>“How in the devil do you know where my
knowledge-place is? You may have it all and
I will find me another resting-place.”</p>

<p>“Pat, you do not understand me. I meant
that you must tell what you know about this
Pearson and his brother. Explain what you
mean by giving me all the place of knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Well, your honor, you see I have been
wanted here and there so manny times I found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
meself a resting-place outside of this office, so
I could be here when you wanted me—and when
you didn’t want me.”</p>

<p>“Do you call that a ‘knowledge-place’? I
should call it a ‘resting-place.’”</p>

<p>“I rested while I was getting my knowledge.”</p>

<p>“You were reading, were you?”</p>

<p>“Devil a bit did I read.”</p>

<p>“How, then, did you get your knowledge?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you have things that you try to
keep from hearing—and indade I tried to keep
from hearing the poor family crying, I was
dropping a few tears meself—then—”</p>

<p>“You heard the conversation, did you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know if that is what you call it, but
I don’t care to hear anny more of it; the last
toime I felt the way I did was when the only
friend I ever had died, and that was me dog.
I never had a poor father or mother—if I did,
they never told me about it; but one kind lady
told the good woman that raised me I was too
small to know me father and mother, so I don’t
know anny, and if I had anny—God bless ’em!—their
son never had to swear all the children
was dead to get what the old folks left.”</p>

<p>“Pat, you have heard all about this, have
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know what ‘this’ is. You mane
have I heard something about this poor man’s
troubles?”</p>

<p>“Here are the officials, now. You may go.
I shall send for you.”</p>

<p>“I am glad I can go. I am not going to
meet the high officials. They might be so high
I couldn’t make meself heard. I’ll just sit meself
down.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Good morning.” “Good morning.”</p>

<p>“Why have we been called?”</p>

<p>“Mr. McHenry, there has been trouble here
in regard to one of the prisoners who is a very
poor man. Strange things have happened since
he has been in the prison, and the strangest
part of all is that he is a brother of Officer
Pearson.”</p>

<p>“A brother of Officer Pearson?”</p>

<p>“The man was convicted of murder on circumstantial
evidence.”</p>

<p>“Of murder—a brother of Officer Pearson!”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ll explain further. I have a telegram
here, stating that the real murderer has
confessed.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am glad. I hope that his brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
is not a murderer. I have a high regard for
Officer Pearson.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, the worst is yet to come. Mr.
Pearson is himself under lock and key.”</p>

<p>“I dare say you are telling the truth.”</p>

<p>“I am, sir. He was heard trying to bribe
his brother to swear falsely—to deny his own
name.”</p>

<p>“Pray, what was that for?”</p>

<p>“I regret to say that he has swindled his
brother out of his part of the estate by swearing
the brother was dead. By doing this, Mr. Pearson
fell heir to the entire estate, which was large,
and he lost it all, except the home which his
family now occupies.”</p>

<p>“The poor man! What was the amount?”</p>

<p>“In the hundreds of thousands.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! How sorry I am to hear that
about Mr. Pearson!”</p>

<p>“You have not heard all yet about Mr.
Pearson. I am going to explain it all. He
threatened to kill his brother if he did not swear
that he had been registered under an assumed
name. In that way Pearson hoped not to be
recognized as the convict’s brother.”</p>

<p>“You are relating something that can be
verified, are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get your information?”</p>

<p>“I have a very trustworthy guard that overheard
some things.”</p>

<p>“You are not believing all these things from
hearsay, are you?”</p>

<p>“I have heard enough myself to be convinced
that Mr. Pearson is guilty.”</p>

<p>“Call Mr. Pearson in.”</p>

<p>“Well, here is where I bring in the fellow
with the black eye. I’ll just step to the door,
by accident,” said Pat, outside.</p>

<p>“Pat, step in and show Mr. Pearson in.”</p>

<p>“I will, your honor.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you have him in there, have you,
locked up?”</p>

<p>“I believe I mentioned the fact that I had
him under lock and key.”</p>

<p>“My god, man, what have you done to
this poor man?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pearson, I am sorry to see this.”</p>

<p>Pat muttered in a low voice: “You would
be doing a good turn if you would go to the
poor wife and give some sympathy to those
beautiful daughters. They have never stole
annything and threatened to kill afterwards if
the one they robbed hollered about it. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
given him a good bating, and I think it did him
good, but I never want the ladies to come here
again and do anny more crying. I had to drop
a tear meself.”</p>

<p>“Officer, what does this mean? Did you
allow that Irishman to beat this poor man like
this before his family?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; his family were not here.”</p>

<p>“He spoke of their tears.”</p>

<p>“They were here afterward, and—”</p>

<p>“Go on and tell what happened. I am astonished.”</p>

<p>“I have explained what he did. I do not
see why, as he has violated the law, he should
not be locked up as any other prisoner is.”</p>

<p>“A man is not guilty until proved so.”</p>

<p>“And I order this man to be turned loose.
You have no authority to claim him as a prisoner.
He has never been arrested, no warrant
for him has been issued, and I do not believe
him guilty.”</p>

<p>“I am in a position to prove his guilt.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe you, sir.”</p>

<p>“I shall ask Pearson to speak for himself.”</p>

<p>“You—Mr. Pearson I am speaking to—please
tell the officials here what you told your
wife and daughters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am willing to plead guilty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my God! And my son to marry a
daughter of this man! I can not allow him to
do so. Take Pearson away—take him away and
do what you please with him. I have heard
enough from his own lips—‘I plead guilty.’”</p>

<p>“Come, McHenry, I have had nothing to
say, and now I do not want to say anything.
I have heard enough.”</p>

<p>“This is awful. My son to marry this man’s
daughter! The engagement was announced last
night. The marriage shall never take place.”</p>

<p>“Come along, Mr. McHenry. We can talk
that over after we leave here.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Well, Pat, you may place the prisoner in
cell 77.”</p>

<p>“Come along. You are a fine bird, you are.
You are not satisfied with ruining your own
reputation, but you had to bring sorrow to your
daughter. Your children must suffer along with
yourself. I pity the poor young man that is
engaged to marry the girl. I have been there
meself. I was engaged to a beautiful girl, and
when the father found out some things he would
never listen to me marrying her, and it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
because I stole all the money I could lay me
hands on; it was because I was a Irishman.</p>

<p>“Well, you have got a nice place here. ’Tis
a pity you had not been here all the time, then
you would have had all your money yet.</p>

<p>“I’ll drop around male times, and see if you
have the same as the other gentlemen get here.”</p>

<p>“I am not fully decided what to do,” said
the superintendent. “I must write at once and
acknowledge the receipt of this telegram, and I
must see that the proper authorities get the
confession of this man Pearson, and place him
where he should be. And if Clarence is proved
innocent, he ought to be freed at once.</p>

<p>“I hear a faint knock. I hope that it is not
Pearson’s wife. I must open the door. They
know that I am here at this hour of the day.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Gertie.”</p>

<p>“I have brought papa something to eat. I
had such a hard time to get this for him. Mother
and sister went shopping, and while they
were gone I did some baking and brought it to
papa. May I see him?”</p>

<p>“I will see that your father gets it, Miss
Gertie. If you are in a hurry to return before
your mother and sister get home, you had better
go at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no! I want to see papa. I want to
tell him something. Is he not in this room
where he was before?”</p>

<p>“Well, no—I—had—to use that room, and
I gave him another room. I think that he is
asleep now. He had a very restless night. I
feel that he should not be disturbed.”</p>

<p>“Officer, I must see him. I want to tell
him something. I have a secret to tell him—not
exactly a secret, but it is to papa, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, but I shall have to deliver the
message for you. I am worthy of your confidence.
I do feel very sorry for you and your
father. Pray trust me with the secret. I’ll
deliver it as it is given to me.”</p>

<p>“Officer, I am heart-broken. I do want to
see papa.”</p>

<p>“I think I have him where I can put me
hand on him, and I hope I’ll never have to
put me club on him again, for I feel sorry every
toime I hear the daughter cry. Poor girl! I
hope she won’t come here again. If she does,
I hope she will lave the tears at home, for
every toime I hear her cry I think of me poor
dog,” said Pat, outside. “I’ll be going along
by the office and see if I’m wanted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here comes Pat. I’ll have him bring your
father in, if he is not asleep.</p>

<p>“Pat, save yourself the bother of coming
in, and go and see if Mr. Pearson is awake. If
so, tell him I want to see him.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Guard—Pat, please bring papa. If
he is asleep, waken him and tell him that I
am here.”</p>

<p>“I was in hopes the poor girl would not
come again, but here she is, and bring him in
I will. It’s the furst toime in me life annyone
called me by the handle to me name. It’s
always ‘Pat,’ but she called me ‘Mr. Pat.’ I’d
do annything for the girl. I’d even treat the
father nice. Poor man, maybe, after all, he
really thought his brother was dead.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pearson, your honor, will you please
come along with me, and oblige me? Your
beautiful daughter is in the office and wants
to tell you something.”</p>

<p>“Pat, I do not care to see her. I know
how the poor girl will feel to leave me, and if
she does not see me, it will not be so hard on
her nor on me.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would come. She is waiting
for you, and indade, I’d be disobeying orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
to go back without you, and I don’t want to
take you, as I have done.”</p>

<p>“I will go, then. Pat, you talk like a good
sort of a fellow, after all, and I’ll go peacefully
with you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. This is a wise man.”</p>

<p>“Miss Gertie, we have visiting rules. I will
give you this card, and you can see the days
we have for company.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Officer! could I not come any
time? You know I have to watch for my chance
to get away. I could not see papa often enough.”</p>

<p>“Now, you may step in and talk with your
daughter. I have some very important business
to take care of.”</p>

<p>“Pat, come around soon again. I may need
you to take some mail to the train, as I am
anxious to have the letters go at once.”</p>

<p>“Well, I may as well sit meself down and
get some more knowledge. I hope I will not
hear anny crying. Poor girl, how she did rush
to her papa and kiss him! If I had a daughter
to kiss me, I would fall dead,” mused Pat.</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, I am so glad I could come and
bring you something to eat! Mother and sister
were out shopping and I found the opportunity
to bring this to you. And I so wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
to bring you some news. Papa, you know Amelia
is going to marry Clyde McHenry? Oh,
papa, you are so pale! Are you ill?”</p>

<p>“Daughter, I fear the marriage will never
take place.”</p>

<p>“Why, papa? The engagement was announced
last night, and the date set six weeks
from then. Would you object, papa?”</p>

<p>“No, daughter; I would not interfere with
the marriage, but—but—”</p>

<p>“Well, papa, what do you want to say?”</p>

<p>“It will all be known soon enough, and the
dear girl will suffer, I know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear papa, don’t cry so hard! I am
trying to be brave for you, and I want you to
for me—and Amelia will be happy.”</p>

<p>“Well, if the man isn’t crying! It’s not
enough to hear the ladies, and when the men
begin I’ll have to move on, I think. I have
enough knowledge for to last the rest of me
life,” muttered Pat.</p>

<p>“Pat, you may take this letter to the train.
Pat, you are wanted. I wonder if he has forgot
his orders.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the devil take you! I’m coming, as
soon as I get these tears all out of me eyes,” mumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Pat. Then aloud: “Yes, I’m coming.
What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>“Mail this letter on the morning train. Do
not delay getting it off.</p>

<p>“Miss Gertie, I shall have to ask you if
you have visited long enough with your father?”

<p>“I am very thankful to you, sir. I shall
visit papa soon again. I hope that I may be
allowed to see him any time when I can get
away. You see, sister is making arrangements
for her marriage, to take place in six weeks,
and she and mother will be away from home
at different times. I could then hurry and come
to see papa, and please, officer, could I be admitted
at any time?”</p>

<p>“Miss Gertie, I should like to grant you the
privilege, but I fear I can not do so. I am
sworn to follow prison rules.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how cruel! To know that I could not
be allowed the pleasure—the only pleasure I
have—of seeing my father!”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry. I would help you to do
anything possible without violating the prison
rules.”</p>

<p>“Dear child, go now. You must, as you
know that we are not obeying orders, and I am
very thankful for the pleasure the officer has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
given us—to see each other. I want you to
thank him and go.”</p>

<p>“Papa, I did thank him, and will again. Oh!
if I only knew that I could return often to see
you, I could go more contentedly. Good-bye,
dear papa. Do not worry, papa; I shall always
be your Gertie, and a dutiful daughter.</p>

<p>“Good-bye. I thank you, officer.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pearson, you have a beautiful daughter,”
said the superintendent as the girl passed
out; “not only in looks, but she is good and loyal
to her father. How proud I should be of a
daughter like her!”</p>

<p>“I am proud of her. And I am ashamed
to think that I have brought on her this disgrace.
I feel that I shall never again be able
to hold up my head, if I should get out of here.”</p>

<p>“Do not talk like that. We can live down
disgrace and you can show the world that you
are not a bad man, after all, at heart, and I
don’t think you are, Pearson.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad I made the train all right,”
said Pat, “and I got the letter off. I feel better
now—not so ornery. I will take me toime going
back. What do I see? The dear little girl
that called me name with the handle on it?
And I do believe she is crying. Now, I can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
stand to pass her and see her shedding tears.
What could I say to comfort her? Well, if I
don’t say anny more than ‘howdy,’ it will help
some.</p>

<p>“How do you do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I was not looking up, and I
didn’t see you.”</p>

<p>“I know you didn’t see me, but I saw you,
and I want to spake to you, for sympathy’s
sake.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, Mr. Pat. I am so sad to
think I can not see papa often. I can not get
away always on the visiting days, and would
have to come when I could find the opportunity.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will see if you can not get in when
you come.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! you are very kind, but the officer
in charge said that he was sworn to do his duty,
and the rules of the prison are, ‘No visitors
except on visiting day.’ I shall have to come
when I can get away on visiting days.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope to be able to break the rules.”</p>

<p>“You must not do so on my account, or
make any attempt to do so, Mr. Pat.”</p>

<p>“What could I say next?” thought Pat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will be looking for you if you will say
when you will call to see your father again.”</p>

<p>“I do not know that I could come when I
would plan to do so—if I could come on the
days set aside for visitors.”</p>

<p>“Well, may I ask how I could help you?”</p>

<p>“I do not know now. I thank you. Oh,
yes! please be kind to papa, won’t you, please,
Mr. Pat?”</p>

<p>“That I will, indade! I will, and I will see
that he has plenty to eat and drink. Now I
must move on back to me job. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“He has promised to look after papa, and
I shall be so grateful to him for his kindness—shown
to my dear, heart-broken father. I will
beg my mother again, when she has relented
toward me, to let me visit my dear papa on
the right days. What pleasure I shall have,
looking forward to the times when I may see
him, if mother will only consent!”</p>

<p>“Pat, you back? I think it has taken you
a long time to go to the train and back. Why
the delay?”</p>

<p>“Well, your honor, I am back and ready
to do annything you want me to.”</p>

<p>“You may see that Mr. Pearson is locked in
cell 77.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Pearson, will you kindly come along
with me? I am not doing this as a pleasure,
but as my sworn duty.”</p>

<p>“Pat, I understand your position. I know
I had to do many things I did not like to do,
but I understand the prison rules, and I’ll obey
orders.”</p>

<p>“You will please step in here, Mr. Pearson.
I am going to see that you have plenty to eat
and drink. That I promised your daughter.”</p>

<p>“You promised my daughter? When did
you have the opportunity to talk to her? I
have been in her presence each time and all
of the time when she was here, and she has
visited me only twice.”</p>

<p>“Faith, and did you not hear the officer
ask me why the delay? Well, as I was coming
back from the train I met your daughter, and
she was feeling bad, and I felt sorry for her
and tried to comfort her the best I could, and
I bade the time of day to her.”</p>

<p>“Was that all of the conversation you had?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I asked the poor, heart-broken
girl if I could do annything for her, and the
only thing I could do to help her I couldn’t do,
but I offered to try, but she shook her head and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
said, ‘No, indade.’ She don’t take after you
for honesty.”</p>

<p>“Pat, what was the help you offered her?”</p>

<p>“You understand the same as meself that
the rules here don’t allow visiting only on visiting
days, and the girl said she couldn’t always
get away on visiting days.”</p>

<p>“What could you help her to do, Pat?”</p>

<p>“I thought, perhaps, I could change the
rule.”</p>

<p>“Pat, you are a good fellow, and I do not
know how to thank you for all of your kindness.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. I don’t need anny thanking
for bating you. I got me spite off you then.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what is keeping Pat so long,”
thought the superintendent. “Did I tell him
to return? I do not believe I did. Well, I’ll
throw the lock on and step around and see if
I can see him near. I will just walk toward
the new prisoner’s cell, and perhaps I may meet
Pat.</p>

<p>“Almost there, and I do not see him? I’ll
just step up and look inside cell 77.</p>

<p>“What do I hear? Pat’s voice inside? I
must find out what this means.”</p>

<p>“Pat, you have had a hard time all your
life, working, haven’t you?” said the prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Me b’y,” returned Pat, “I never knew
annything but work.”</p>

<p>“Well, Pat, don’t you think that a man
would be foolish to work if he could live without
it?”</p>

<p>“Indade I do.”</p>

<p>“Pat, would you like to live without working
if you had a chance?”</p>

<p>“I would be a gentleman if I could. They
was always something about a man that did
not work I rather admired, and wondered how
they felt, dressed up all the time.”</p>

<p>“Pat, if you had the chance, you would try
it, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, faith, and I think I would.”</p>

<p>“Pat, you understand what I’m here for?”</p>

<p>“Faith, and I don’t want to be here for the
same purpose you are, to be a gentleman, or
to be a officer as you was.”</p>

<p>“No, that was by choice, Pat, I was here.
I have plenty of money, and now it will do me no
good, if I am to stay in here, and if I were out
of here, I would have enough to last us both
the rest of our lives. Now, Pat, can you find
a way to get me away from here, so this place
will never see nor hear of either of us again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, me friend, what would be the job
I would have after we got away from here?”</p>

<p>“Did I not tell you that you would never
have to work any more?”</p>

<p>“And I would be a gentleman, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you would, Pat. Now, let me plan
this. You are trusted, and the superintendent
has confidence in you, and you can get me out
of here, and walk out yourself, and then we can
leave the country together.”</p>

<p>“And what would the poor man do without
me help?”</p>

<p>“Oh, go along! What does he care for your
help? There are many others who would be
glad to take your place, and you would be a
gentleman then, Pat. Just think of it!”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t think of a gentleman in me,
as I never was one.”</p>

<p>“Of course, you always had to work, but
you will never have to if you get me away
from here. Come, Pat, wake up! You may
never have the chance again to be a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“I will study this over and see if I want
this chance. I feel the cold chills run up and
down me back. Does that belong to the appearance
of a gentleman?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“It does. You see, just talking about it,
you are feeling the gentleman vibrations.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think I have got the plot, and
what I miss now I can get along without. I
will hasten to the office,” the superintendent
whispered.</p>

<p>Pat continued: “I think I’ll be getting
along back to the office, Mr. Pearson. The
superintendent will be after asking me, ‘Why
the delay?’”</p>

<p>“Come around often, Pat, and talk to me.”</p>

<p>“That I will. Well, I am a gentleman, or
can be if I want to give up me job here.”</p>

<p>“Pat, I have been looking for you for some
time. You are not so lively as you used to be.
Are you feeling your age? You look worried.
Pray tell me what is the trouble,” said the officer
as Pat entered the office.</p>

<p>“I have no trouble. I am wondering how
a man feels that don’t have to work or have
anny trouble.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Pat. I never had such a
job. I always had to work hard for my honest
living.”</p>

<p>“Then the gentleman that is called the gentleman
is not honest?”</p>

<p>“Not all, Pat. It would not include all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
wealthy men, but it would close the bars around
some of them.</p>

<p>“Yes, and after the bars is closed, it is hard
to get away, isn’t it? I was thinking what a
⸺ of a time a man would have to get out of
town if he could get from behind the bars.”</p>

<p>“Some prisoners have got away and were
never found, and again, some were caught in
the act of getting away.”</p>

<p>“And the results, if caught?”</p>

<p>“Pat, are you thinking of helping someone
away? I never before heard you talk this way.”</p>

<p>“I am thinking of the past, if a fellow lost
his job, and of the future, if he found another
one better.”</p>

<p>“Are you thinking of leaving here, Pat?”</p>

<p>“Not if annyone would know it, I’m not
leaving here.”</p>

<p>“You know, Pat, I have always esteemed
you very highly, and I should be very much
disappointed if I had to lose confidence in you.”</p>

<p>“You would be glad to place confidence in
me, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I surely would place all the confidence in
the world in you, and would trust you with all
of the prisoners and feel as safe as if I were
here myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“I would take care of them one at a time—no
other way.”</p>

<p>“I know you would, Pat. I feel confident
you would now, after this talk with you.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you feel that way. I may never
hurt your feelings more than once.”</p>

<p>“We can always forgive once, Pat, and sometimes
twice, but you know the old adage, ‘The
third time is the charm.’”</p>

<p>“They would be only two and the third
time would not be here.”</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">A Clear Conscience Better than Money</span></h2>

<p>“I do not understand, Pat, what made Pearson
confess so meekly. He could at least have
pleaded innocent until his trial. You know
sometimes things look dark, and then a criminal
can get out of it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he thinks he can get out of here.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will not have his trial here and
now, without judge or jury; so, Pat, you may
go and see if all is right among your fellow-men.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if he understood what I meant
to tell him all the time—what I was going to
do—when he said he could forgive once and
twice, and the old adage. I just as good as
told him it would be twice, two of us, and the
third time not here, and that was the daughter;
she is not here to help get away, so there is the
whole thing in a nut-shell. And the blockhead
did not get it.”</p>

<p>“I think Pat thinks he will make his get-away
with his prisoner, and be a gentleman.
I’m sorry for Pat. Now I have a problem to
solve within myself. Shall I let him go ahead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and make his plans, or shall I stop him before
he gets started, and save the poor Irishman
from occupying cell No. 76? I believe I can
gain some knowledge by being deaf to it all.
He is surely a clever Irishman, and I will see
what plans he will make to escape with his
prisoner, and I may be gaining knowledge, but
I could not do so by sitting on Pat’s seat of
knowledge, so I think I will not leave this
office.”</p>

<p>“I hope that I shall receive a reply in regard
to the real murderer, and that he will be brought
here. That will help to open the way to a
clear discovery of all this plot.</p>

<p>“What! A knock? I do hope that I shall
not find a lady there.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, officer.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. McHenry.” The visitor
was Mr. McHenry, junior. “What can I
do for you?”</p>

<p>“I should like to talk with you in regard to
your new prisoner, Mr. Pearson. My father
brought me the news, and I am not doubting
him, but I truly would be better satisfied if I
heard it through someone else also. Father was
in such a rage that I could not calm him enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to understand the circumstances. I should appreciate
your explaining it all to me.”</p>

<p>“My boy, I am very sorry to say that I
have to do my duty and the rules here we must
comply with. We are not allowed to give out
any information in regard to our prisoners, except
to the officials.”</p>

<p>“I ask for only enough to understand. Do
you not see that I am in trouble? Can not you
help me? Do tell me that he is innocent. It
means so much to me.”</p>

<p>“My young friend, I understand the circumstances.
I learned them through your father.
I am sorry for you and for the daughter of this
man, but I am powerless to do anything.”</p>

<p>“Could I talk with him?”</p>

<p>“No; I am not allowed to permit any information
to be obtained inside of these prison
walls.”</p>

<p>“I am sure that it would never be known.
I would never divulge the secret.”</p>

<p>“I have confidence in you, but I should not
be obeying rules here, and I could not allow
you the privilege under any circumstances.”</p>

<p>“I shall have to go, as I am unable to learn
anything. Oh! could I not see him, just for
one short conversation?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am sorry. I must repeat that I can not
allow you your wish, so please do not insist.
It makes me feel bad to know, as I do, your
predicament, and to hear you plead. I can
not help you. There, I would not do that!
The guard is coming. It is not necessary to
let him see you shedding tears, and I would
rather you would go before he comes in.”</p>

<p>“I will go. I thank you for your sympathy,
and I am certain you would have granted my
request if it had been in your power to do so.”</p>

<p>“I would, certainly. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good day, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, now I am getting in deeper. Even
the poor young man’s heart is broken. Engaged
to the belle of the city, and not allowed
to marry on account of the misdeeds of her father.
Poor boy! My heart did ache for him
when he broke down and cried.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am after coming back. Do you
need me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I do, Pat. I am looking for
some very important news. Outside of that,
I would let you take charge of the office and I
would take a stroll through the prison. I get
very tired, sitting here from morning until night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and I like to take a walk around the inside walls,
now and then, for exercise.”</p>

<p>“You may do so. I will watch the place.
I will see that no one comes in.”</p>

<p>“Will you see that no one goes out, Pat?
That is what I am here for. Very few want
to break in and many would like to break out.”</p>

<p>“You are not thinking of any one in particular,
are you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Almost any one of the prisoners
would walk out if he had the chance.”</p>

<p>“If they did, I surely would walk out with
them.”</p>

<p>“We are not looking for trouble, Pat. It
probably will come soon enough. Open the
door. I thought I heard a rap.”</p>

<p>“So you did, and so did I.”</p>

<p>It was a messenger-boy. The communication
read:</p>

<p>“We have a prisoner here, a confessed murderer.
Will leave for your place in the morning.”</p>

<p>“All right, no answer,” the superintendent
called to the waiting messenger.</p>

<p>“I am so glad to receive this.”</p>

<p>“Is that the looked-for message?”</p>

<p>“It is, and the self-confessed murderer will
be here to-morrow evening. With him they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
will bring the papers releasing No. 78, Clarence
Pearson, an innocent man. Do you know anything
about this, Pat? You sit there and do
not look alarmed or excited over anything I am
telling you. I usually act so when I understand
it all.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have nothing to say. If I did, I
would say it without you asking me to. If I
am not wanted, I’ll stroll around; or do you
want me to keep house and you stroll around?
It is nearly bed-time.”</p>

<p>“No; I think I shall retire, as I have been
somewhat worried to-day. I shall lock up at
once, and try to get around early in the morning,
Pat. We shall have a new man to take
care of to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that, sir.”</p>

<p>“Now Pat is gone, and he will no doubt go
at once to 77 cell and tell Pearson all he has
learned. I wanted him to know that the man
is coming and the brother would be a free man.
I think I had best get some more information,
so I’ll just drop around and rest a while
in 76 cell and see what the plot will be, as
Pearson must know that he will have his trial
soon. I feel certain that the officials have been
prolonging matters through pity for the family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Mr. McHenry was probably slow to take
action because his son was engaged to Pearson’s
daughter. Of course he would try to avoid
scandal as much as possible. I’ll probably find
Pat busy with his prisoner, fixing up their plot,
so I’ll lock up here and step around. What?
I see Pat’s going in now. I must hurry to get
the first of the plot.”</p>

<p>“I’m here, me friend.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you, Pat. We must decide
to-night upon some way to make our get-away
from here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and if we are not careful, the brother
will bate us out.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard anything?”</p>

<p>“Have I? Well, I heard it all. The real
murderer will be here to-morrow, and then what
will they hold him for?”</p>

<p>“My brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your brother.”</p>

<p>“We must be out of here before to-morrow
comes. What can we do? Now, Pat, make
your wits work fast.”</p>

<p>“I am thinking, and the main thing I’m
thinking about is the money to make the gentleman
out of me. Where is the money?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t let that worry you, Pat. I have
plenty.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you have plenty, if you give your
brother back his money, you would be out of
here as soon as he would, and save all scandal,
and he a poor man freed from here, wouldn’t
he keep his mouth shut if he could be made a
gentleman out of?”</p>

<p>“Pat, you do not understand.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, explain it to me so I can understand.
Can you do it?”</p>

<p>“I have told you that you would never have
to work any more and you could be wearing
fine clothes all the rest of your life, have I not?”</p>

<p>“That you have, but does that make it so?
I’d like to see a pile of greenbacks in front of
me before I explain anny further.”</p>

<p>“You see I am here tied up and can not get
away. How can I show you the money?”</p>

<p>“Well, me friend, what is better than a clear
conscience? Do you think money and a gentleman
could show you a better time?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I would not let a conscientious
mind prevent me from having a good time the
rest of my life.”</p>

<p>“Me friend, your money is not showing you
a good time, and the rest of your life your conscience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
will hurt you, and the pity and shame
you have brought on your family—and those
beautiful daughters—their lives are ruined, all
by yourself, your greediness for money. No,
me friend, I think I would rather be a hard-working
Irishman all the rest of me life and
have a clear conscience.</p>

<p>“Pat, you are a coward. I thought you
would help me out of here.”</p>

<p>“I did not help you in here, and why should
I help you out?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to go back on all the arrangements
we have talked over?”</p>

<p>“That is what I do. Now I’ll be telling
you.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what made you change your mind
and talk this way?”</p>

<p>“Because I heard someone talk the other
way.”</p>

<p>“You heard someone talk the other way?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I fully intended to be a gentleman
and help you out of this prison, and I thought
I would walk around and think it over and see
how bad I wanted to be a gentleman, and I
got tired and sit meself down in the comfortable
chair in the hospital, and there I was thinking it
over and I was trying to think if I wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
be a gentleman all the rest of me life, and when
I asked meself the question I heard the answer,
and, faith, I never had me mind made up yet—I
was going to think about it a while—and I
listened, as if I was hearing someone talking,
and behold! I did, and I looked around, and
not a soul was in sight, and I asked another
question, and I got the answer again, and I
thought: ‘If you know so much and can answer
all of my questions, I’ll be giving you a
job.’ And I had a regular conversation with
them, and in the conversation I asked them
how much money you had, and they told me
not enough to get out of the trouble you was in,
so I think you will need it all, and I had better
not try to handle anny of it for you.”</p>

<p>“Who was this you were talking with that
gave you all of this information?”</p>

<p>“Well, me friend, I don’t know. I did not
see annyone, but I surely did hear someone.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do—let me stay
here and serve whatever time is given me?”</p>

<p>“Well, what have I got to do with getting
you out?”</p>

<p>“Look here! I’ve got you now where you
will have to get me out, or I will get you in
here to occupy the next cell, 76.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hardly think! That is taken. The murderer
that is coming to-morrow will have that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am going to get away from here
before to-morrow. I shall report to the office,
if you do not help me out, of your accepting a
bribe, as you agreed to do, to assist me in getting
away. And they will look at it this way: If
you can be bought off, you would not be a
competent man to have in here. And that
means you would lose your job, and you would
find it hard to get employment elsewhere, for
your dishonesty would follow you wherever you
went.”</p>

<p>“Just as yours have done. And, me friend
Pearson, I have not committed the crime yet,
and now I know, I never shall, so you just as
well keep your head shut, for I am now in a
position where I might show you some favors
that I will do; but I will never show you the
way out of this place.”</p>

<p>“I am doomed to die here! It will kill me
to have sentence passed on me in court, and I
am guilty, and it will be proved. Pat, won’t
you please help me out? I will do anything
for you. I will give you my beautiful daughter
Gertie, whom you so much admire.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind. I am after seeing one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
young man in trouble because he is in love with
one of your beautiful daughters, and I’ll be
after loving a girl whose dad is out. I won’t
have to come to the penitentiary to ask for
his girl.”</p>

<p>“Then you have decided to allow me to remain
here, have you, Pat?”</p>

<p>“I’m not the court.”</p>

<p>“You are not going to help me out?”</p>

<p>“I am not.”</p>

<p>“You shall rue this day. I shall explain
everything to the office to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go, then, and let you think about it,
so you will have a good story to tell. Good
night, Pearson.”</p>

<p>“So Pat has weakened! I’ll see how he
talks in the morning. I feel certain that to-morrow
the officials will take steps to bring
Pearson to trial, and I know that with what
proof we have—and he has also pleaded guilty
in the presence of the officials themselves—he
will be sentenced for a number of years. I
must now return to the office. I think Pat is
out of sight. The crisis will come to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Well, me friend is mad because I do not
help him out of his trouble and help meself into
trouble. I wonder where I heard that voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
I’m glad I heard it when I did, and not after
I did the dirty work.”</p>

<p>“<i>My boy, I was following you all the time,
and would not have allowed you to commit the
crime.</i>”</p>

<p>“What do I hear? Another voice, or is it
the same? Well, me friend, I am a brave Irishman,
and just as long as you want to talk to
me you may do so. I’ll sit here the rest of
the night, and I won’t have long to wait. It’s
nearly morning now. But I would of lost manny
a night’s sleep, perhaps, if you had not of told
me. Whoever you are—I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“<i>And I am not going to tell you, now.</i>”</p>

<p>“I heard the words: ‘I am not going to
tell you, now.’ I must be after getting out of
this, for I’m hearing things, I am. I wonder
if that strange voice has returned. I thought
they—whoever it was, or whatever it was—had
gone, never to return, but I do belave they
have come back.”</p>

<p>“I think Pat will be around soon, and I will
pretend that I have had a restless night, and
that I will not go to bed at this late hour,”
thought the superintendent. “He will be thinking
this over and will not get it off from his
mind. I shall be anxious, for I have been worried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
very much in the last few weeks. Yes,
here he comes.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Pat.”</p>

<p>“I’m not feeling anny too good, officer.”</p>

<p>“What is wrong, Pat?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m after telling you at once. I’ve
got meself in the penitentiary.”</p>

<p>“Of course; we’re all in here, but not from
force.”</p>

<p>“And I never would be here by choice, but
I’m deserving of punishment, and I wish you
would give it to me unbeknown to annyone of
the higher officials, and I would plead guilty.”</p>

<p>“Pat, what is wrong? I never heard you
talk so before.”</p>

<p>“And I never did do so before.”</p>

<p>“Have you committed a murder?”</p>

<p>“No, your honor. But I come near liberating
a convict. You have not the confidence
in me anny more you once had, or never—”</p>

<p>“Well, I am sorry, for I had a friend in you—or,
at least, I felt so.”</p>

<p>“And now I’m friendless, a lone Irishman,
and I will soon be a convict.”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to want to tell me what
is wrong, and I want to talk with Pearson to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
The telephone always rings when I am
talking.</p>

<p>“Hello! Yes. You want me to bring Pearson
to the office and read to him the warrant
which I shall receive this morning? In the mail?
His day for trial is set? All right, sir; I will
obey orders. Good-bye.</p>

<p>“Pat, you may bring Pearson in. I see the
mail is here, or soon will be.”</p>

<p>“May I ask of you one favor?”</p>

<p>“Yes. What is it, Pat?”</p>

<p>“If a fellow—scoundrel, I think, is the best
name for me—should repent of a crime before
it is committed and never was committed, would
you or could you forgive him? Could they send
one of them things you are looking for when
the postman comes in? Could they send one
of them after me to—”</p>

<p>“Yes, Pat, if you are self-confessed criminal
of some deed you have committed, you surely
would receive one of those warrants.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t I die when I was a babe, instead
of me poor mother, and she here in me
shoes and I in hers?”</p>

<p>“You must bring Pearson in here. Here is
the postman.”</p>

<p>“I will, your honor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now for the dirty work of me poor
self to be found out. I could see the wrong
in others, and could not see when I was tempted
the wrong I was doing, and I, like those here
who committed crimes, will have to pay the
penalty for it. I do not like to see this man
Pearson go to the office this morning, but that
is the orders, and I must bring him in. Here
I’ve been wandering along and thinking of me
own case, so I ’most forgot what I was sent for.
This is his cell, and he is fast asleep, but I must
awake him and take him to the office at once.</p>

<p>“Say! you! here! wake up! I want to take
you for a walk.”</p>

<p>“I am not asleep. I was just resting.”</p>

<p>“Very well; come along. Your presence is
wanted.”</p>

<p>“And your presence will be wanted too, some
day, if you don’t change your mind before we
get to the office.”</p>

<p>“I shall never change my mind, not after I
was told as I was and given such good advice
from some unseen force.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking how to tell the whole
story, and you will regret the day you changed
your mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“I may do so. Here we are. The office is
waiting for us, so come along.”</p>

<p>“I say, Pat, are you going to change your
mind before we enter the office?”</p>

<p>“Well, Pat, what are you debating about?
Come along here. Time is flying,” said the
superintendent.</p>

<p>To the prisoner he said: “You are under
arrest. You have been here accused of obtaining
money under false affidavit, and I shall have
to say—Pearson, I regret very much to have to
read this to you, but I am sworn to do my
duty, and I have done so in this case, as I
would do in all others. Your trial is set for
one week from to-day.</p>

<p>“You may take him back, Pat.”</p>

<p>“Your honor, I have something to say.”</p>

<p>“What have you to say, Pearson?”</p>

<p>“I will ask you if you have ever noticed Pat
acting strangely, as if he was in a deep study?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I have noticed it. I have
had so many things to think of in the last three
or four months. I do not really know if I have
been noticing Pat very much, as he is one of
the guards whom I can trust among all of the
prisoners. I think Pat is very reliable—a very
reliable man to have here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“If I ever get out of this. I will never do
anny more dishonest work, or even talk or think
about it. I pray me poor mother may help me.
Now, you never did annything for me here on
earth, mother, come down from Heaven, if you
are there, and help me, plase do help me keep
me reputation up in this Pearson case, in the
eyes of the whole world. I now realize what
it means for a boy to make his first mistake.
He is ruined for life, and if all of the young
men knew what I do now, they would never
start to commit anny crime.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Pat? Mumbling to
yourself? No one can understand those sounds.”</p>

<p>“I understand what he is doing. He has
himself just where I will be soon, locked up in
this place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Pearson! you always had a grievance
against Pat. I have never seen any cause
for it—none at all, I say.”</p>

<p>“You will have, after I have explained all.”</p>

<p>“You may take him back, Pat. It will soon
be time for the Southwest Limited to arrive.
Due in a half-hour. Make haste.”</p>

<p>He mused: “Pearson is one of those men
who, after he has been caught, wants to catch
everyone else, and he will tell all on poor old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Pat. I am so sorry for him. His first mistake,
and a bad one at that, but I hope Pearson will
be enough of a gentleman not to make him
suffer for it. His conscience will hurt him enough
for his part. I always placed so much confidence
in Pat. I am heartily sick of the whole
affair. One man can commit a crime and drag
others down with him. Here comes Pat. He
looks tired and worried.”</p>

<p>“Well, your honor, I am back after a hard
time I had getting the officer into his cell.”</p>

<p>“Pat, why should he say what he did? Have
you had some trouble with him, that you did
not tell me about?”</p>

<p>“Your question shall be answered, but not
to-day, not to-day.”</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">The Murderer Arrives.</span></h2>

<p>“Here is our new prisoner, the self-confessed
murderer, and Clarence Pearson will be released.</p>

<p>“Open the door, Pat.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir. I have a prisoner for
you.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Please register, here.”</p>

<p>“You will have to, for me. My wrists hurt
so I am not able to hold a pen in my hand,
to say nothing of writing.”</p>

<p>“Your name is—”</p>

<p>“William Devenart.”</p>

<p>“A very odd name you have, Mr. Devenart.</p>

<p>“Pat, you may take care of him. Give him
his bath and shave and new suit, then return
to the office with Clarence Pearson.”</p>

<p>“You poor, unfortunate fellow, you come
along with me. Tell me all about yourself.
I’m a guard here, and will trate you nice if
you trate yourself so; but I want to give you
a tip: Do not disobey rules. It will be better
for you. How long are you sentenced here for?”</p>

<p>“Life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“My man! A life sentence, indade! You
will eat manny a meal with us, and I am not
sure but what I will ate some off the same
table.”</p>

<p>“Do the guards and prisoners all eat together?”</p>

<p>“No, not always; but sometimes the guards
turns into prisoners.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand you.”</p>

<p>“I do not know what I did mane, to do
what I did. Here is the place. Clane yourself
up and don the new suit, and very seldom do
the styles change—I belave once in ten years,
from stripes to checks. You will feel cool after
you have been shaved and have a hair-cut.
One advantage, you’ll not be needing a comb
very soon.”</p>

<p>“Don’t they allow you to comb your hair?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; but you don’t have anny to comb.”</p>

<p>“Going to cut my hair off?”</p>

<p>“Sure, Mike—do all of ’em. And won’t I
be a peach if I have to get me own hair cut?</p>

<p>“The poor boy don’t look like a criminal.
I will be kind to him. I could see tears in his
eyes when he was talking. If all of the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
men could see some of these heart-rending cases,
I do feel we would have less crime.”</p>

<p>“What! A lady coming here? I do believe
it is.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Pearson, come in,” said the superintendent.
“How do you do, Mrs. Pearson?”</p>

<p>“Good morning. I should like to see Mr.
Pearson.”</p>

<p>“Your husband?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I have disowned him, but I want
to talk with him. I have some papers I want
him to sign. I also have an order from Mr.
McHenry allowing me to see him, as your rules
could not be broken to accommodate anyone.”</p>

<p>“No, madam, I could not break the rules,
but with this order I can let you see him. I’ll
ring for a guard to bring him.”</p>

<p>“I am to have a private conversation with
him.”</p>

<p>“I can not allow that, madam. You must
say what you have to say in my presence, in
this office.”</p>

<p>“You are one of the most accommodating
men, I must say, that I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, very. I have heard you express
your opinion of me, but I am here to do
my duty, and will at all events. Here comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the guard. I will have your husband brought
in at once.</p>

<p>“Bring the prisoner from cell 77.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear! You have him locked up, and
call for him by his number, do you? And he
has not had a trial, nor has he been convicted
of any crime.”</p>

<p>“We have a warrant for his arrest. His
trial will be this week. I hope that he will be
able to prove his innocence. I am very sorry
for him. I have grieved over the matter considerably.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have not grieved at all. I am going
to disown him after I get his signature. Then
I shall have all the property in my own name,
and I shall try to forget that I ever had a husband—a
criminal. My daughter Amelia will be
married one week from to-day, and we can not
be disgraced by coming here after the marriage
takes place, and that is why I am here to-day.
Is that he coming?”</p>

<p>“No; I have a prisoner who is to receive
his freedom, and that is Pat, bringing him in.
By the way, that is your brother-in-law.”</p>

<p>“How dare you insult me in that way? I
acknowledge a criminal as a relative? No,
never!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, here is your ‘fellow,’ No. 78. I can’t
say ‘prisoner’ anny longer. He gets his freedom
to-day, and me old shoes will have to go
with him, for I don’t think I can get them to
track anny other direction after the prisoner 78
is gone out. Have you sent for the officer convict?
Here he comes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Pat. Don’t you see Mrs. Pearson
sitting there?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, madam. I very seldom
see a lady.”</p>

<p>“All brutes of men are alike.”</p>

<p>“Pearson, you may come in. Your wife is
here to see you, and you may be seated over
there. I will look after your brother, here. He
gets his freedom to-day. The real murderer is
in his new suit, and will be given his occupation
in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Did I hear that I am a free man?”</p>

<p>“You are, Clarence. Here are the papers.”</p>

<p>“And my brother? Oh! what will you do
with him? Turn him loose?”</p>

<p>“No; not until we hear from the court. He
will have his trial this week, and I hope we will
then be able to turn him loose.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pearson addressed her husband as he
approached her: “I want you to sign over all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of your part and interest in this home we, your
daughters and I, occupy. I will not live under
a roof owned by a criminal, and you shall be disowned
at once. I have already made application—before
my daughter is married, I shall
have all ties broken with you.”</p>

<p>“I am not going to sign over any of the
property. It is not mine at all. It belongs to
my brother here. I spent and lost all of my
estate, and that is why I am here to-day. I
swore that he was dead and in that way got
his share, and what we now have is his. He is
alive and free, and he is innocent, and here am
I, a criminal and guilty, and bound down here
for no one knows how long.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear brother! is this your wife? And
she spoke of your daughters. You have not
told me anything about them. I can not see
you separated from them all for the loss of my
money. What would I do with it, now, to
know that I would cause so much misery to
obtain it. I could not be happy. Oh, if I
could only step in your shoes and you in mine!
I would gladly do so. And you, my dear sister-in-law,
how sorry I am to know that this has
happened!”</p>

<p>“If you had never committed a murder—you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
I say—feigning mercy for your brother, we
would not have to suffer.”</p>

<p>“I am not a murderer. Here are my papers
of freedom, and the real murderer is here in
my place—self-confessed, and he will be punished
for the crime. If my dear brother could
only be found as innocent as I am, you would
have your beautiful home always. As it is, I
shall claim what is due me, and what was left
me by the will of my dear mother.”</p>

<p>“You may have a hard time to get it.”</p>

<p>“I am willing to turn all over to my brother.
He is entitled to it, and it belongs to him,”
said the husband.</p>

<p>“Get some water, Pat. Mrs. Pearson has
fainted.”</p>

<p>As she revived Mrs. Pearson asked that a
carriage be called.</p>

<p>The superintendent replied: “You may step
into this room. I will call one.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pearson, you may return to your cell.
Pat, take him back to 77.”</p>

<p>“Oh, brother! what can I do for you?”</p>

<p>“Pray for me. You got me here. Except
for you, I would be a free man.”</p>

<p>“Clarence, you may sign here. Here are
the papers of freedom. I want to shake hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
with you. I hope that you will never again
be placed in such a position,” said the superintendent.</p>

<p>“I thank you, sir. I am under obligations
to you for many favors, and I hope that you
will always be as just to all the other prisoners
as you have been to me.”</p>

<p>“I shall try to be. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, sir.”</p>

<p>“Your carriage is here, Mrs. Pearson.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, officer.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, madam.”</p>

<p>“Drive to 1715 North Twenty-third Street,”
said Mrs. Pearson.</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">Remorse.</span></h2>

<p>“Now, Clarence has his freedom and has
left the prison. Next comes the trial of the
officer, and poor Pat, what a predicament he
is in! I must have him for a witness in this
case. I must try to find out all he knows, and
if it will not assist any in the Pearson case, I
will try to get along without him. Well, I
thought Pat just stepped out to avoid the Pearson
scene. I hope that he will return soon. I
shall have to notify the officials of the new
prisoner’s arrival. Here comes Pat.</p>

<p>“Well, Pat, I thought you had walked away
with Clarence Pearson. The poor fellow was
a happy man when he left this place.”</p>

<p>“They will have the same thing to say when
someone else walks away from here.”</p>

<p>“Pat, I did not say ‘they’; I said ‘I.’ To
whom are you alluding as ‘they,’ and when
who walks away?”</p>

<p>“Well, your honor, I am the next to give
the papers to, and please give me my papers of
resignment. I don’t believe I want the job<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
anny longer. I am not after looking for a long
job here.”</p>

<p>“It is bed-time now, Pat. To-morrow will
bring forth something new. Pearson’s trial will
take place, and probably you may have to fill
his office, as assistant, here with me. We shall
have to have another man in his place. I think
you could do it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I could probably fill the place he is
now about to fill. I am not looking for the job,
indade I am not.”</p>

<p>“Pat, you are worried to-night. So much
excitement the last three or four months has
upset you. It will have to be settled—all will
be settled after Pearson gets located, and now
it is late, and we must retire. Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night, officer.”</p>

<p>Pat muttered: “As I hear the big iron door
slam after me it makes me blood run cold. I
am in a fix. What is money for? To make
criminals, I belave. I belave every convict under
this blooming roof is here for or on account
of money. The vile stuff! We get a living,
and have to work, or should if we don’t, and
it only keeps us out of mischief—and then it
don’t. I am in it now, and I have been working
too, but there it leads up to money, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
fine clothes and the gentleman, and the good
times that would go with it. I would be able
to go and lay me head down on me pillow to-night
and slape if it wasn’t for money. Instead
of that, I have to pace around this place
all the night. Yes, here it is nearly morning,
and not a wink of slape. I’d just as soon be
guilty, as so near and not, for I am taking on
the same guilty condition. I belave I’ll walk
around and see if me friend is worrying over
me as much as I am meself. What? I hear
him talking to the new prisoner. I’ll see if he
is telling him how to behave himself. I don’t
belave they placed the new man in 78—yes,
indade, they did. I remember, he said the real
murderer would be occupying Clarence’s cell
and Clarence would have his freedom. Well,
he is talking very nice to the new man. I will
see what the conversation is about.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about it,” said Pearson. “How
did you come to confess that you were the real
murderer of this woman? They had a man
serving time for the crime.”</p>

<p>“Yes; that is why I confessed, and for other
reasons.”</p>

<p>“What were the other reasons? Would you
mind telling me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am trying to forget it. I will tell you,
and then I shall never repeat it again. It is
too horrid; I can not stand it to talk about it.
I was married only a short time, and a difference
arose, one day, between my dear wife and
myself. I became angry, and was talking loudly,
when the door opened and this fellow who
was serving time here for the crime came rushing
in unannounced, and asked my wife if he
could assist her. She was afraid of me, but
she declined to accept his help. He left with
apologies for intruding. I grew more excited,
and in a fit of uncontrollable temper I choked
her to death. I came to myself and found her
lying at my feet dead. Oh, man! can you picture
the agony I was in? I thought of that
man, and how I could lay the murder on him.
I ran from the house and met an officer. I
told him my wife was just murdered by a man
whom I had just seen leave the house. The
officer rushed up the street, and I recognized
the man as the same who had offered to help
my poor wife, and I shouted, ‘There he is!’
and to jail the officer took him. At the trial I
swore that he was the murderer, knowing that
I myself was the guilty one, and he was the
man who was given his freedom to-day. I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
tell you all, as I have started. I know that
all the time he was here I suffered more than he
ever could.”</p>

<p>“In what way, Devenart?—is that your
name?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but just call me ‘Will.’ I do not
want to disgrace my father and mother by causing
their name to be spoken.</p>

<p>“I can not tell you in what way. I can tell
you the mysterious way I was punished. I
never lay down and closed my eyes that I did
not see my poor dead wife, and presently another
woman would come up to me and point
her finger at me with scorn. After many terrible
nights, I began to hear noises. I could
not at first understand, and one night I was
touched by some unknown hand, and I was
frightened beyond words. I thought, ‘If I could
only die and get away from it all!’ I am so
excited now I can not talk longer.”</p>

<p>“I should like to have you finish. We may
not get a chance again, as you know the rules
are, ‘No talking among the prisoners.’”</p>

<p>“I am glad that I have rested to-night without
seeing her face, and I will never tell the
story again. As I am here for life, I know that
I never shall, if we can not talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“One night, as I was sitting on the side of
my bed, I could not lie down and close my
eyes, and I saw my wife walk up to me, and
by her side came an elderly lady, and I tried
to close my eyes so I could not see them, but
I could see them as plainly with my eyes closed
as with them open. I stood up and begged
them to go away and let me rest for the remainder
of the night. Then, for the first time,
I heard a voice, and it was the motherly lady
who spoke, and these were her words—oh! I
am telling the terrible story under a dreadful
strain; I am living it all over again. I thought
I saw the same lady standing by your side, as
I am looking through these bars.”</p>

<p>“You will have strength, I hope, to tell me
all. Please finish the story.”</p>

<p>“I will finish now, if I am—oh, she spoke
to me! Was that where I left off? I believe
it was. The elderly lady came closer than my
poor wife did, and as she spoke I can never
explain the feelings I had. I called for help.
I prayed and fell down on my knees and asked
for mercy and help. The voice answered:</p>

<p>“‘<i>So did your wife pray for her life, and it
was not spared—by the hands of a brute, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
that was you. Now you suffer as you have caused
her to suffer—I say suffer!</i>’</p>

<p>“My friend, can you think of a punishment
like that? I could bear punishment from the
hands of my fellow-men, but when I know not
from whence it comes or what it is, it is terrible.
I am suffering for all the sins I ever
committed.</p>

<p>“My man, I see, I do see, the same lady
by your side, and my wife!</p>

<p>“O Father, come to me in this hour of need.
I am being punished for the terrible crime I
have committed. May I not be shown mercy?
I am guilty, and have pleaded so, and will plead
guilty, even in my prayers to Thee. Help and
forgive me. How I have suffered! Thou knowest,
and Thou alone. From this on I shall live
as I should—pray every day for the forgiveness
of my sins. Each day will I pray for guidance
and help in all my undertakings. Help me to
live the way I should live. Turn not a deaf
ear to me, O Father. I am in sorrow and need
Thy help. I am here that the one who has
received his freedom may go forth with Thy
blessing; that the whole world may look on
him as an innocent man, and not as a murderer,
as I swore that he was. I ask also for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
help for him. May he forgive me. I may never
have the opportunity to meet him on this earth,
but I hope to meet him in Heaven, as innocent
of all crime as he was of that of which I accused
him. O blessed Father, I do feel that Thou
wilt answer my prayers. Amen!”</p>

<p>“Well, well, you can pray as well as murder,”
said Pearson. “I was wondering if you ever
prayed before.”</p>

<p>“No, my friend, and if you would experience
the heavy burden lifted from your shoulders
as I did from that prayer, you would pray,
or try to, as I did.”</p>

<p>“I think I had better get away from here,
if they are going to have prayer-meeting,” muttered
Pat. “I wonder if a bit of a prayer would
do me good. The first chance I get, I belave
I will do a little of it. Well, here is another
day, and nearly time for the trial. I had better
step in the office a bit.”</p>

<p>“Pat, your absence this morning makes me
think you had a good night’s rest.”</p>

<p>“I will call it rest when I get it. Indade, I
never closed me eyes.”</p>

<p>“Was anything wrong with the prisoners?
I was going to ask you to go by cell 78 and see
our new prisoner, and it passed from my mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“I did the very thing that passed from your
mind. I guess it came to my mind.”</p>

<p>“Is everything all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We had some prayers, and I think
it helped the fellow that prayed, and I am
thinking of doing a little of it meself, when I
get a chance.”</p>

<p>“The poor man! Remorse always sets in
after they get in behind the bars, Pat. Do
you know that this is a hard place to be—to
work for a livelihood? You have no trouble of
your own, but you worry about the other fellow’s
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Faith, and if I had no troubles of me own,
I would let the other fellow worry about his
own.”</p>

<p>“You have no troubles to worry over. See
how long you have been here, and you could
not get into trouble here, could you?”</p>

<p>“No, I couldn’t, but I have.”</p>

<p>“You have? Tell me, Pat, what is wrong.”</p>

<p>“We had better put that off.”</p>

<p>“It will soon be time for Pearson’s trial,
and you will be one of the witnesses. As he
has confessed that he is guilty, I think it will
go hard with him.”</p>

<p>“Now, me friend, your honor, I’m not going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
to kape the secret anny longer. I just as
well have it out with, and you may cut down
expenses and have two trials at once. I have
a secret to tell you. Every bit of it is the truth,
and I too am going to confess, and then, when
I get the chance, I’ll pray, and perhaps I too
will feel better.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Pat.”</p>

<p>“I am after listening, and I heard the man
to be tried to-day trying to spend five thousand
dollars easy, and I thought: ‘If you have it
to give away, I meself would take a little of it.’
And I in a way as much as told him so, and
then I changed me mind. I thought I would
like this job the best. Now he insists I spend
his money, and I don’t want it at all, and I
told him so. Now he has threatened to turn
me over to the officials here if I don’t be a gentleman,
and I never was one, and now I know
I couldn’t be one, so there is the secret.”</p>

<p>“Well, we must now attend court. You
will have to tell all you know, Pat. You may
go for Pearson and take him to court. I will
be there presently.”</p>

<p>“Here is me punishment beginning now. I
am after getting a taste of it meself. I may
be the next poor devil to court. For the love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of Mike! what will I do? Pray? I haven’t
the time now. I will after I get through with
this trial, and then I may have something to
pray for. Here I am at the cell, and I belave
he’s aslape. Now, I wonder if he was awake
all night. I’m not aslape, and I was up too,
all night. I will get him out of here.”</p>

<p>“Come, Officer Pearson! Your trial is at
hand, and I have come for you.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing to go, Pat—and say, Pat, are
you for me, or against me?”</p>

<p>“I am neither, if I don’t have to be.”</p>

<p>“If you are called to the stand, what will
you say—anything about our plot to get away?”</p>

<p>“Will you say anything about it if I am
not called to the stand?”</p>

<p>“I’m not quite sure if I will or not, Pat.
I must be out of here, and if you will get me
out, I will not mention anything about your
offering to liberate me.”</p>

<p>“If you think you can get away without
my help, you may do so—if I don’t see you;
but if I see you, you won’t get away. Here we
are at the court.”</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">Pat’s Testimony.</span></h2>

<p>“You are taking your time, Pat. We are
waiting for you.”</p>

<p>When court had been opened and the preliminaries
had been gone through, Mr. Pearson
was examined.</p>

<p>“You are registered under your correct name,
are you not?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pearson, how long has your mother
been dead?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-one years.”</p>

<p>“Did she leave a will?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did you know that you were the only
heir?”</p>

<p>“No, sir—well, I thought so.”</p>

<p>“But you did not know for sure?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pearson, did you take oath that you
knew your brother was dead?”</p>

<p>“I did; yes, sir. I thought he was. We
had never heard from him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you look for him, or try to find him?”</p>

<p>“Well, no.”</p>

<p>“Did you acknowledge him as a brother
when you did find him?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Not until you had to.”</p>

<p>“Well, I tried to do for him after I found
him.”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“I told him I would help him.”</p>

<p>“Out of prison, or financially?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you were going to
do, but you were going to do something for
him?”</p>

<p>“I felt that I should.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell the court what you were going
to do, or thought of doing? Now, Mr.
Pearson, you have been holding a position of
authority, have you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Have you done an officer’s duty?”</p>

<p>“I have tried to.”</p>

<p>“You tried to, but did you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“You are excused.”</p>

<p>Pat was called to the stand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your name?”</p>

<p>“Me name is Pat Dugan.”</p>

<p>“Well, Pat, what do you know about this
Officer Pearson?”</p>

<p>“Your honor, I wish I had never seen the
man.”</p>

<p>“That is not answering my question.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know what he did all the
time, but I know I wish I did not know what
he did anny of the time.”</p>

<p>“Answer the question.”</p>

<p>“Plase repeat it, I am after forgetting the
question.”</p>

<p>“Tell what you know in regard to this case.
Did Officer Pearson fill his position as an officer
should?”</p>

<p>“Now, me friend, I don’t think that is the
same question at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, answer it, if you do or don’t think
the question was worded just the same.”</p>

<p>“I did not hear the last question. I was
thinking of how to answer the first one. Now,
me friend, I will ask you to repate the last
once more, and I might answer them both.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we must have patience with you,
for I don’t think you were ever in court before,
and I know it is hard for you. Now, once more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
I ask you about Officer Pearson’s conduct as
an officer. That is a short question and you
should be able to answer it without hesitation.”</p>

<p>“I will say that I think the job is a hard
one for me, and I will give you my club and
quit at once.”</p>

<p>“Sit down, Pat! Sit down there and answer
these questions the attorney is asking you,
or I shall fine you for contempt of court.”</p>

<p>“Could I get off—out of that fine for contempt
of court—as aisy if I told the truth?”</p>

<p>“I am asking you a question now, and I
wish you would answer.”</p>

<p>“Faith, and you have been asking me some
questions I didn’t know how to answer, and I
am only a ignorant Irishman, and you are one
of the know-alls, or should be. I’ve always
thought that if annything ever came up with
a business consideration, ‘I will ask me lowyer
about that.’ This is the first time I have ever
been smart enough to talk to one of them
lowyers.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are taking your time to talk.
You must like our company.”</p>

<p>“I like to hear a smart man talk, indade
I do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, the court would like to know if this
is a trial, or a complimentary case.”</p>

<p>“Your honor, I am trying to get the witness
to answer my questions.”</p>

<p>“Put the question to him again.”</p>

<p>“Now pay attention, Pat, and we will soon
be through with you.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you turn me loose now? I am
feeling sick, me man. I am sick.”</p>

<p>“Get him a drink.</p>

<p>“Here is water. Take this, Pat. Drink
some water. You are all right now.”</p>

<p>“You know everything in the books, but you
don’t know how a fellow feels inside, and plase
don’t talk to me—plase don’t. I wonder, if I
would pray, would I feel better? I am going
to pray, gentlemen. I belave me toime has
come right now.</p>

<p>“O Father in Heaven, if You ever send
blessings to the Irish, send this one Irishman
some now. I need it. O me God, I did not
do annything. I changed me mind before I
let him go, and he is here, and You can do as
You plase with him. I am through with him.
I think You will know what he needs, and give
it to him. Have mercy on me, and him too,
if he is deserving of it. I don’t think he is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
but Your judgment is best, and use it, and be
sure You use good judgment in my case, and
help me out of this terrible perdicament, and
if I never get in another, I won’t pray anny
more. You will see I am in earnest and don’t
delay the job. I am awfully sick, but I think
I feel better now, and if the court will have
mercy on me, and You do likewise, I know I
will be well in a few minutes. Help Your wandering
one all alone in this country. Me poor
mother has been with You a long time, and if
I was there too, I would not be here, in this fix.
And now I have prayed for the first time in all
me life, and if You don’t answer, I shall say my
prayers were all in vain; but if You will let me
know that they were heard, I will let you hear
them again, if I get in trouble. Amen.”</p>

<p>“The judge spoke: ‘Stand up, Pat. You
are good on praying, and you have a nice way
of doing it, if you did convict yourself. Go. I
don’t think your crime is punishable, and I want
to give you some orders. You had better learn
to pray now, and do some of it. Don’t wait until
you are in trouble and then ask the Lord to help
you. Serve Him all the time, and you will then
be guided, so you will not have to ask for help
in time of trouble. Too many wayward boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
like you, Pat, get in trouble before they ever
think of praying. I hope that the Father to
whom you prayed has heard your prayers. I
feel that He did, and that is why I am going
to turn you loose; so you may say your prayers
were not in vain, but go from this court-room
with prayers on your lips, and pray often. It
will do you good. Now you may go, and may
God bless you.’</p>

<p>“Well, if I ever get me another job, I will
never get it in a prison—I may not get out so
aisy next time; but the poor man, he is there
yet, and I never told a word of his trying to
give me all his money and fine clothes.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be willing to work, now, for all
I get. And I’ll say to meself: ‘Didn’t the
man who was boss of the job make a fine
spache to me?’ He must know nearly as much
as the lowyer did, and I felt sorry for him when
he felt sorry for me and told me to pray. Faith,
and I will pray, and I will kape it up as long as
I live, and after I am dead I will come back
and scare some of the poor devils and make
them pray like the new man. Oh, how he did
pray when he thought he saw the dead woman!
And it was that very thing got me started to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
praying, and only for that I belave they would
of hanged me this very day of me life.”</p>

<p>“Well, here I am back to the office, and I
have me clothes all here, and I want to bid
me old friend good-bye before I go. I can’t
kape the tears back. I guess I am feeling
pretty bad again. I belave I’ll just step in
here and pray to meself now, while I’m waiting
for me old friend that thought so much of me.”</p>

<p>In the court-room the trial proceeded. At
length the judge arose, saying:</p>

<p>“I am not of the opinion that a crime of as
long standing as this one is punishable in the
eyes of the law. Twenty-one years would outlaw
it. If the prisoner will give his penniless
brother a home for life, I will set him free.</p>

<p>“What have you to say to that, Pearson?
Are you willing to share your home with your
brother?”</p>

<p>“I thank your honor. I am more than willing,
and I will see that he shares my home as
a brother should, without feeling under obligations.”</p>

<p>“Pearson, I feel that you mean all right, and
I will ask you to let me hear from you as soon as
you find your unfortunate brother who was freed
several days ago. I want you to help him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
live down the disgrace of his long imprisonment,
and live as brothers should. We have all learned
to pray through this unfortunate affair, or we
should have learned, and that not waiting until
we are in trouble, and then expect our prayers
to be heard, but we have learned to pray at all
times—not as Pat did, if we get help, say we
won’t pray any more until the next time we
are in trouble.”</p>

<p>Later, when Pearson appeared at the office,
he said: “Officer, I am discharged from all,
including my position, am I?”</p>

<p>“Well, Pearson, we have been holding consultation
in the side room—the officials and I,
and we have decided to reinstate you, and Pat
also. We have decided that this lesson will
make honest men out of you and Pat, and
trusty. You did not betray Pat and he did
not betray you. It was a good principle that
you both showed this morning, and we feel that
you will work hand in hand together in the
future. I wonder if Pat has gone. We will
step over to his room and see.”</p>

<p>“I hope that Pat will feel kindly toward me.
I have forgotten all, and will always remember
that trial—how poor Pat feigned sickness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
avoid answering those questions. Poor old Pat!
He is a good Irishman.”</p>

<p>“I do believe that he is gone. This is his
room, is it not?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Here he has left a note. He has
written: ‘Good-bye to all the poor fellows in
here. I have served me term and am ready
to go, but with tears. I am thinking I am all
alone, save God. He is ever near me. Good-bye
to all fellow-men!’”</p>

<span class="smcap smaller">Prayer-Meeting in Prison.</span></h2>

<p>“That is the first time I have seen you
break down.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Pearson, I am heart-broken. I shall
never forget Pat, not for the sickness he feigned,
but for the feeling that came over me when he
was praying. I have never prayed, but I am
going to this day. And the very next Sabbath
I am going to start a prayer-meeting in this
prison. If it helps all as much as it did Pat,
I will feel repaid for all these mysterious voices
and visions which we have heard and seen here.
Besides, it may lift up many a sad heart inside
these walls, that could get no help except through
prayer.”</p>

<p>“You locked the door as you left the office,
did you?”</p>

<p>“Only the outside door.”</p>

<p>“I see bundles in there. They belong to
Pat. He has not gone.”</p>

<p>“Take a look into the room next the office,
Pearson.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my God!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“What? suicide?”</p>

<p>“No; praying.”</p>

<p>“Pearson, close the door.”</p>

<p>“I am after being through and I feel better.
I have been praying to me Father to help me
find another job, or to get this one back for me.”</p>

<p>“Pat, your prayer is answered, once again.
You may remain and do as you have done.
Outside of this little trouble, you have been a
good, faithful man, and I feel that you and
Officer Pearson will from this day on be faithful
to the trust which is imposed in you, and
that you will show brotherly love and kindness
toward each other and all your fellow-men. I
want you to be sure to be at prayer-meeting
Sunday morning, and open the meeting with
prayer.</p>

<p>“I shall expect you, Pearson, to close the
meeting with prayer. I will take a hand at it
myself, and I hope that we may hear the voices
of all in this prison, asking for help and guidance
and peace.</p>

<p>“Now, Pat, see that all is right.</p>

<p>“Well, Pearson, I am glad to see you sitting
there under different circumstances, and I hope
this will be a lesson for us all. Honesty is always
the best policy. If you follow that precept,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
you will never get into trouble,” said the
superintendent, addressing Mr. Pearson.</p>

<p>“Well, here is one good Irishman the rest
of me life, and I will be after being a Sunday-school
teacher; I think that would bate being
a gentleman anny time. And now I’ll see if
the officer has not forgot to put the poor man
that was brought in to work. Forgot? I know
he did. I’ll be after going and asking where
will I take the poor fellow to work, and I’ll
ask mercy for him, for it means a job for life
with him, poor fellow. I am after passing the
knowledge-seat. I will walk in and tell me
business at once. I got enough knowledge to
do me at that resting-place.</p>

<p>“What do I see? The poor fellow that was
turned out of here sitting in the office? I will
pretend not to know him, and make my business
be known and lave at once.</p>

<p>“Officer!”</p>

<p>“Yes. What is it, Pat?”</p>

<p>“You have been after forgetting to give the
poor man his life job.”</p>

<p>“So I have, Pat. I will find a place in a
trade where he will not have to toil so hard,
for it means a long time for him. I will take
care of that Monday morning, Pat. Don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
bother him. Let him get used to his new
clothes and room. You may go, Pat. I’ll take
care of him Monday.”</p>

<p>“So you have come back to see us, have you,
Clarence?”</p>

<p>“Yes, officer. I could not rest and know
that my brother was here in prison, all on my
account. I am the cause of it all. I should
have written home after I left. I should have
written to my dear mother. Then I could have
been notified when she died, and poor Oliver
would not be in this trouble. That is why I
am taking all this disgrace upon myself.</p>

<p>“Brother, I am going to help you, but not
in the way I asked you to be helped at first. I
am going to take you home now, and introduce
you to my family, and try to have a family
reunion, in honor of the prodigal son’s return—in
honor of poor mother.”</p>

<p>“You may go now, Mr. Pearson. I can
spare you for a few hours.”</p>

<p>“Come along, brother. Clasp my hand and
we will walk hand in hand to my home—or,
rather, yours, and we will spend the rest of our
days together.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how beautiful your voice sounds to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
me, Oliver! As I walk along by your side I
feel as if we were indeed beginning a new life.”</p>

<p>“By the way, we shall have a wedding soon.
My daughter Amelia is to be married to-night,
at ten o’clock—yes. And we shall be there
on time, I see. The place is all aglow. I
wonder—”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I wonder how I will be received.”</p>

<p>“You must be treated as my brother, and
the family will do so. Music? Yes, Gertie,
playing ‘Home, Sweet Home.’ There is no place
like home. Oh, how true! We will surprise
them. Just step in, Clarence.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, papa!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Gertie; I heard you playing just as
I feel, that there is no place like home.”</p>

<p>“Mother, see who is here.”</p>

<p>“My dear wife, I want you to meet my
brother, as a gentleman—which he is, and has
been proved to be.</p>

<p>“And, Clarence, this is Gertie, my pet now,
as I must soon give Amelia to someone else.</p>

<p>“I hope that he will be as kind to you,
Amelia, as your father has always been.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“Father, you have been good and kind to
me. You gave me all I ever asked for, and I
want you to forgive me for the way I treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
you when you were in trouble, I am truly
sorry.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and, dear husband, I shall always
look on that time as the mistake of my life.
For doing as I did I will ask you in the presence
of your brother, and mine also, to forgive me.”</p>

<p>“My dear family, you are all forgiven. Now
I ask that you show love and kindness to my
dear brother and share our home with him—or,
rather, thank him for sharing his home
with us.”</p>

<p>“We shall always treat you as one of the
family, brother.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Clarence, we are going to have
a wedding to-night! Sister Amelia is going to
get married to Mr. McHenry.”</p>

<p>“And, Uncle Clarence, I want you to stand
up with us.”</p>

<p>“Gertie, go to the piano and play ‘We’ll
Sin and Sorrow No More.’”</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
